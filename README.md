# The Zoo at Yale University

For a long time, the Zoo website has been out of date and perhaps not the most useful of websites. This Sinatra project, started during the "mini-hackathon" at Yale University February 2, 2013, is an attempt to fix that. Little effort, however, was given to ensure compatibility with old and defunct browsers (i.e. IE) or mobile (yet), so please excuse any design inconsistencies there.

Run as a regular Sinatra project from the root directory, or with `shotgun`. To receive data about Zoo computer availability, you must upload the `server` directory to a Zoo machine, compile per the instructions in `MyServer.java` and change `ZOOMACHINE` to the appropriate animal in `views/coffee/main.coffee`. Then again, it might just work anyway :)

### Happy coding!
