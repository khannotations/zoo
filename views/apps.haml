  <tr><td>Tymo Ussui Nakao<br/>Unicamp<br/>Other <br/>tymo_nakao@hotmail.com</td><td>It is the be a hub for engaged people to gather and discuss about Education and its future, just that it sounds AWESOME, I am particularly interested in Education right now, getting in touch with different systems but also thinking about how to innovate and improve the current model that can be found in the world. Brainstorming and having deep discussion with people that share the same impression about the need for change will be an incredible experience.
  Thus I have to say that this girl that I engaged in the IDDS with (a project run by MIT D-Lab that combines design thinking and social impact) - Miho Kitagawa recommended to participate in the program, although she hasn't been yet. I said to myself then: I will try!</td><td>There could be happening many things in 10 years, one thing that I might be doing is residency in some area (e.g. Cardiology, Neurology) because I am a Second-year Med Student in Brazil. I could be an architect and be engaged in various projects. But one thing that one of my mentors made me realize is that I like the science of artificial, that is, creating something by man's hand, which englobes architecture and medicine in the same category. So I would like to be engaged in projects that I could create and transform other people lives positively.
  What I also like to do is to make other people happy, it is very pleasant to see the smile or laughter and to hear a "thank you". I would like to be spreading always this contagious happiness and inspiration and be engaged in different world problems particularly health and education. Education is something that bothers me a lot (actually right now more than health) because it is all the path I have been through so far, since kindergarden, elementary and high school, admission process to universities, university life per se, exchange experience. It is a subject that concerns me very much right now. So I would like to be helping people achieving happiness and comfort, tackle the education problem that the current model faces and to develop a mechanism so that more people get healthy.</td><td>SOAR!!! Find and pursue your passion and dreams. Love your life!</td><td>It is very common among adolescents that they don't know what to do with their lives or how to achieve some of their goals. The class would first address the problem with the current educational model and how inadequate it is to thrive on current world. The focus on memorization and labelling, the limited exposure to the world urgent problems and conflict resolution skills, the limited exposure to real teamwork and cultural exposure, the educational content driven by ancient top-down scheme and big focus on the standarized tests (especially country like Brazil and Japan).
  If would be presented that there is possbility indeed to transform the current educational model and to bring a novel method of learning, much more interactive, efficient and fun. To engage people in real learning, there would be briefly presented some web tools such as Udemy, EdX, Blogs and Ted talks, book reviews.

  There would be some comparison among countries regarding their educational model and discuss how it can affect the economic and social outcome of it. Furthermore there would be presented some cultural features of the country and check if it correlates with the educational model.

  There would be an enphasis during all the lecture of not being in the comfort zone, it might be sometimes difficult when you are not in the comfort zone but definetely it is one of the best way to stimulate yourself and to discover better about yourself, so trying new things such as e.g. Ballet concert, composing a song, cooking for friends, taking a sculpture course are a great method to make the best out of yourself. 

  It is important to show the failures of the current model but it is more important to instigate the student to achieve their dreams or not to stop to find what they really love. Tell about my personal journey of finding what I love and the way I am tackling it. Afterwards, I would encourage students to talk about what would be a day in which they would say: "WOW, today was simply PERFECT" and to list things that they felt the most happy. Ask them to try to connect their dreams or desire to these and help them achieve some conclusion that they would say: "hey, if I start doing this maybe I will be happy" or "Maybe I really like XYZ, I should explore it more" or "I have no idea of what I like still but this made me realize there are a tens of things that I could engage and explore to discover myself". 

  Create peer mentoring among students to give them tools to discuss more openly about their concerns about future. In the end it would be all matter of showing them that happiness is the goal they should always seek and not be be afraid to get it. help them Soar.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Angie Hanawa<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>angiehanawa@me.com</td><td>As a Latin American of Japanese heritage, I have always wondered what my life would have been like had my parents stayed and raised me in Japan. Whenever I meet up with my cousins and exchange stories of our lives, I’m always amazed at the difference in educational ethos between countries. Having gone to a British school all my life, I have not even experienced my own country’s style of education, so I’m always eager to identify the differences between people’s experiences in school, it’s almost like a game. In particular, I have always heard a lot about the Japanese educational system. Having family there, and of course from the somewhat simplified portrayal of Japanese high schools in anime, mangas and J-dramas, I have always thought it a very interesting, yet somewhat restrictive education system. So when Kenta first talked to me about GAKKO, right after he had come back from Japan, I was immediately fascinated by this initiative to question the system currently in place. Throughout my life I have encountered various people who were trying to look at education in a different way, and when listening to Kenta’s story, I was immediately reminded of my Great Big Ideas professor last semester. Although I can’t really say for sure, I think that when I took that class, I experienced something similar to what the kids in GAKKO do, and I was so changed by that class, by that professor, that I definitely want to help bring that same ‘revelation,’ that same experience, to these kids. I mean, if my parents had indeed stayed in Japan, I could have been one of them.</td><td>Well, this is difficult to answer. What I would like to be doing in 10 years is working on environmental governance – international or probably focused on Latin America. Where would I live? That is still something I am debating, anywhere in Latin America, the US, Western Europe or East Asia. The United Nations is an organisation that has always interested me, but it is just a possibility amongst many. I would love to be travelling a lot, since I know that I will probably be in law school for quite a bit of time after graduation, and have a dog or two, or three.</td><td>The Art of No</td><td>Last winter, when I was in Japan, I saw my first Noh play, and I was shocked at the air of mystery that surrounded it. However, despite its mystique, soon I found out that the art and the format has remained basically unchanged since its origins almost a thousand years ago. The art reduced to a science. Now a Noh actor is considered an expert in his field. With an “emphasis on tradition rather than innovation,” the Wikipedia page says, “actors begin their training as young children” in order to gain the necessary expertise to perform.

  My class would be loosely based off of a conversation I had with my Great Big Ideas teacher recently. It would focus on reviving the spirit of amateurism in the lives of young people, and being able to just say ‘no’ to conventional norms of professional (and educational) stratification like those that occur in Noh theatre. It would be a reflection on the importance modern society places on perfection, and its disregard for true innovation. Nowadays, in Japan, in the US, and even at Yale, there is such importance placed on achieving the highest technical ability, that any attempt to break out of the mould is thwarted by this idea that “I will never be as good as I am required to be.” In the classroom, this manifests in intellectual passivity – a student will just sit there without really engaging or questioning the material or the professor because he feels unsure of his own critical skills, of his lack of experience, or his mere status as a student. Outside the classroom, there is a lack of initiative to try new things, put himself in new situations, and a tendency to stick to what is known.

  The class would be a mixture of debate and improvisation. It could start with students jotting down something that they wish they could do but are too afraid, or think it wouldn’t be ‘productive’ to try. Depending on the task, we would encourage them to do it, and after, present their impressions to the class. Beforehand, we would warn them that they would be questioned by the teachers or the other students about engaging in such an activity, whether it is because it’s impractical or there are so many people better at it than they are – in a sort of debate format, and they would have to defend their actions, why their actions are not useless and why they are not futile. Basic public speaking/debate training would be provided beforehand. Finally, we would have an improvisation workshop, only with the rules reversed. The basic rule of improv is “say yes.” However, in ours, it would be “say no.” Here we would integrate the debate with acting, in several debate scenarios in which the children would be asked to break away from the flow of the act and come up with something completely different, and justify his/her choice, all to ascertain their sense of confidence and individuality.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Minh Nguyen<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>minhhai.nguyen@yale.edu</td><td>As a current film studies major at Yale, I face the issues brought up by GAKKO every day. Even in more the artistic fields, education has a tendency to orient itself around two poles: abstract theory and rote memorization. While I appreciate theory and understand that some concepts must be mastered to continue with higher education, there needs to be more focus on creativity. There has to be more time dedicated to individual creation and more emphasis on artistic perception.

  Instead, in my experience, these notions are all pushed to the side. The key word here is extracurricular - if you want to explore non-theoretical graphic design, film production, or anything outside the fields of academia, you can always look to the various student groups around campus. That frustrates me because I have to ask: why is this considered "extra?" If anything, exploration should be the key focus of education, not shifted aside to the margins. 

  GAKKO seeks to reform this current state of education and I definitely want to be a part of this movement. </td><td>If everything works according to plan, I see myself in sunny California, working at either Warner Brothers or Pixar. Animation has always been close to my heart, so I would love nothing more than to work on the production of the films that have essentially defined my life. 

  However, it would be a dream to work as a producer in any field of television or film. All I know is that in 10 years, I'll be on a set somewhere - the details will follow later!</td><td>Poetry in Motion</td><td>Animation has always ran parallel to poetry - like a poem, animation is an abbreviated art form that can convey emotion and inspire feeling, feelings that can change through the lack or excess of just a few lines.

  In this class, students will look at animated shorts and analyze how different art styles inspire different emotions. They will look at how nuances in form, facial reactions, and body language can contribute more meaning to the story than the narrative itself. By focusing on these concepts, students can then apply these concepts to other aspects of their lives, whether directly within drawn art or indirectly through the increased focus on tone in their other works. 

  At the end of the class, students are then dealt with the tasks of creating their own animated piece. Entries are completely open-ended unless the student is unable to think of a concept – in this case, an emotion will be randomly assigned to the student, and that student must then find out how to convey this in his or her piece.

  The conveyance of tone in any medium is imperative to its effectiveness, whether the medium is a feature-length film, a written text, or even a face-to-face conversation. Perhaps by analyzing a world in which the static suddenly becomes dynamic through the perfected communication of tone, we can better understand how tone comes to be. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Miho Kitagawa<br/>Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br/>Junior<br/>mkitagaw@mit.edu</td><td>I've been interested in starting a program for people with communities to expand their creativity and capacity to solve their own problems through designing in Japan. I started to think about this after I attended International Development Design Summit in Sao Paulo, Brazil this summer, where I with many professional designers developed technologies to solve the real-life problems of people in low-income communities with them. I've been working in the field of engineering for developing countries as well as designing in resource-poor settings, but as a Japanese citizen, I want to change something about Japan. The way I want to contribute is through designing; when people are designing, they become creative and passionate about their topic, which I think is what Japanese people need. I want students in Japan to be more passionate, creative and ambitious about many things. If they once realize that they can make something that may change the lives of people or themselves, I think that's a big change. When I was planning about this program, I learned about GAKKO - and I thought it is great because I share many ideas with GAKKO. I really think that something has to be changed in our education system, and I think with other people who come to join GAKKO, we can change something. I'm still planning to start my design program for people in communities as well, and I think I can get something beneficial for that from participating in GAKKO.  </td><td>Hopefully, I would be managing a group of engineers from Japan, who train research institutes and universities in Japan to hold programs to send their student engineers to communities in Japan as well as neighboring developing countries and work on co-creation of engineering solutions for their lives. This is what Engineers Without Borders in Australia is doing, and I believe that this group would student engineers, educational institutes in Japan and our neighbor countries. Currently, there is a small organization called Engineers Without Borders in Japan, but they are only providing technologies to communities in developing countries, which is not sustainable. What I want to do is to create the capacity in communities so that people there can come up with the ideas to solve their own problems through engineering and designing. Also, I really think that we need to face the problems in Japan as well. Japan is considered to be a developed country in terms of technologies, but we have so many problems especially in education and politics. We should not keep our educational system in Japan, otherwise, many of those who studied in universities in Japan end up as very boring, non-creative and non-flexible citizens. When these people start leading the country, young people lose their faith in their country, start leaving Japan and the country will be rotten. In 10 years, I would have spread the word and started some actions with young people around me toward the change. Although I do not want to work in Japan right now, I would want to be doing something for Japan because I care about it and I want to see some changed happening. </td><td>Becoming a designer</td><td>Are you happy? Do people around you seem to be happy? If not, why aren't they? Have you done something to make yourself/them happy?
  Whenever you start any action, you have to frame the problem you are attacking, think about as many potential solutions as possible, choose several and start your action. This is a so-called Design Process. This is what anyone does in their lives; meaning that everyone is a designer in their own way. In this class, you will discover yourselves as designers and realize that yourself can solve the problems around you, but specifically in hands-on way. You have never built anything with a jigsaw? Or never coded a software? You don't know how to draw? That's ok - you will learn those from your fellows while you teach them something else. Co-creation is what makes all projects fun, better than your initial thought and from impossible to possible. When you leave the class, you will know what to do to make changes with your fellows, and have some new skills that you can utilize. Requirements for the class is the attitude to try and learn anything and passion. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Wahaj Chaudhry<br/>Harvard<br/>Sophomore<br/>wchaudhry@college.harvard.edu</td><td>I first became interested in Gakko when I realized that the organization was about creating new and innovative ways of educating individuals in order to allow them to think with greater creativity and intuition when solving problems. After having visited schools in many parts of East Asia and South Asia, especially primary and secondary schools, I realized that the way that these students were being taught did not vary greatly from one institution to the next. The biggest differences I saw were the availability of resources and in some cases the lack thereof. However, the same fundamental approach was taken to educating children by exposing them to primarily the hard sciences followed by the humanities. The age-old mathematics course, or physics course was still the same as it had been decades ago. What I found most distressing were that there was a severe lack of what I call revolutionary classes. From personal experience, I can say that there are some classes that we taking in our educational careers which can be seen as very dangerous. I say this in the best sense possible. The dangerous aspect of these courses involve the things that will allow us to change our minds completely, or to make big life decisions within a matter of moments. These are classes which open up our eyes to the world beyond and allow us to move away from an insular and protected point of view by broadening our capacity to understand our role in the world and allowing us the freedom to see that there is more we can do to serve society than what we think we can do by taking fundamental science or humanities courses. I believe Gakko would be an amazing way for me to formulate a means of allowing individuals to think in ways that Harvard has taught me to think. To see the bigger picture and to work with a larger goal in mind, rather than simply working to follow established footsteps.  </td><td>In 10 years I See myself working towards some entrepreneurial venture involved heavily with biotech or life science companies. My interests revolve around the development of stem cell therapeutics and the scalability and sustainability of such therapies. I have come to find a greater interest in the industrial sector of medicine and biology and as such see myself working on a social entrepreneurship project, which hopefully, will span continents, rather than just a local community. </td><td>Project Design and Development in the Global Health context </td><td>Every year the brightest and most talented youth of the nation gather at prestigious competitions the likes of which are sponsored by Intel and Siemens in order to present innovative and sometimes revolutionary ideas in all fields of human knowledge. These individuals are driven by mentors, which provide them resources in many different forms in order to allow them to think beyond the straightforward High School curriculum and to develop something sometimes of a caliber that far surpasses work done even in College or graduate school. What exactly is the motivating factor for these students? For some it is the sheer prospect of being recognized at a national level for their passions and interests. For others it is an opportunity to pull themselves out of mediocrity and to display their skills in areas that do not necessarily fall into the categories represented in most public high schools or secondary learning institutions. This course is premised on the idea that the youth are possibly the most powerful resource the world has to solve some of its major problems, specifically those related to global health. My plan for this course is to develop a means of providing students with a platform to develop their ideas and to use their existing skills of creativity to find novel solutions to complex problems. At times professionals attempt to deal with these problems using the vast knowledge they have acquired in their schooling. As such they at times can miss the simplest of solutions to the most complex problems by implying deeming something perhaps “too” cost effective to necessarily be of any use in resolving an issue. This class would be designed to introduce students to the vast array of existing global health problems, the current measures being taken to solve these problems and the reasons why these solutions are and are not working. Following this the course will aid students in developing solutions to local issues within a city, suburb, prefecture, or simply a neighborhood. These issues need not necessarily need immediate attention, but rather through the process of finding a viable solution, the students will be taught means of creating cost-effective programs, which are sustainable, scalable, and adherent to both local legal processes and cultural values. The class would of course introduce a major theme like water shortages/purification, famine, local ambulatory services, disease control, etc. This course is ultimately a means for students to utilize a minimal amount of resources to create a program that will not only affect their community, but set an example for other individuals to follow. It will be up to the students to pose problems, limitations, design ideas, and timelines for their programs. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Youkow Homma<br/>Yale University<br/>Freshman <br/>youkow.homma@yale.edu</td><td>This story begins with my father.  He was born in Japan, went to Hitotsubashi University, and then worked at Mitsui Fudosan for over fifteen years.  He assumed that he would be happy as a salaryman, but after he had risen through the corporate ranks of the company, he realized that he was not satisfied.  He was not pursuing his passion of history and law.   Thus at the age of forty, my father decided to move to the United States and become a lawyer.  As I grew up, my dad recited this story to me, and he explained to me how the United States was truly a window of opportunity for him to chase his dreams in a way that the Japanese schooling and corporate systems were not.

  	Through my elementary school years, my family was extremely close with several Japanese families who lived temporarily in the United States for work before moving back to Japan.  Many of these families had at least one child who is within one year of me in age, and over the years, it has been interesting to see our parallel development in Japan and the United States.  One of these families actually helped my father get acclimated in the United States when he moved here twenty years ago.  Their son, Kanta is just a month older than me, and our parents joke that Kanta and I were friends before we were born.

  	Kanta and I both love baseball.  We both played during our middle school years and Kanta went on to play in high school.  I switched to golf after middle school because I was too small to play in high school.  Every time I went to Japan and he came to the U.S., we would play catch.  The last time I went to Japan, I also got to watch Kanta’s last high school game.  He was pitching for his high school in his regional Koshien game, and he was absolutely brilliant on the mound.  He only let in one run, but his team ended up losing.  After the game, I consoled him by telling him that at least he had the next year, but he surprised me by telling me he wouldn’t be playing.  I couldn’t believe it.  He explained to me that since he was facing his juken year, he and his parents had decided that this would be his last year playing.  I was angry that Kanta had to drop baseball completely during his final year of high school.  In the United States, I was commended for playing golf through high school.  In Japan, on the other hand, Kanta’s passion for baseball was considered a useless distraction.  

  	The frustrations that motivate GAKKO also reside in me through both my dad and Kanta.  During high school, I could not help Kanta and my other friends, but now, as a college student, I believe I can make a difference to younger students.  I would like to be a part of the GAKKO project to make a change.  Even if I can’t overhaul the whole education system, having an impact on a few students’ lives would complete my summer.
  </td><td>Ten years from now, I see myself working to connect people across the world.  I have a hope that as people come to understand each other internationally, there will be greater mutual respect within the human race as a whole.  This understanding can then eventually translate into appreciation for differences, even when beliefs conflict.  

  In particular, I want to connect people in undeveloped countries directly to people in developed countries on a large scale.  I believe that personally knowing someone in a different part of the world is the best way to understand the lives of others.  Many programs such as the Peace Corps allow for United States citizens to conduct service projects in foreign countries; however, I believe that the scale has been small in terms of exposing people to a different part of the world.  

  In this vein I hope that in the future, I can develop a tech company that would allow people to chat with random people in user-specified parts of the world.  Admittedly, this idea isn’t fully developed, but I am currently exploring the idea of a system that would mimic Chatroulette.  Essentially, a user would log-on and specify the region of the world which she wants to explore—for instance, Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Then, she would be connected to chat with a person in Sao Paolo.  The relationships made over these chats could be short-term (simply the duration of the chat), or they could be long-term (virtual pen pals who end up talking on a regular basis).  Either way, the user could come away having made an educational connection with a person from a different nation.

  Outside of work, I see myself living in a mid-sized suburban community while enjoying my spare time playing with my wife, kid, and dog and golfing with my friends.</td><td>Questions to Self-Discovery</td><td>-The goal of this class is to demonstrate how asking questions not only powers thinking but also fuels self discovery.  I would start the class with a simple exercise: study an apple.  As a class, we would brainstorm questions about this apple.  Some possible questions would be: 

  -What species is the apple?
  -How did the apple form?
  -What kinds of animals eat the apple?
  -Does this apple have any medicinal value?
  -Can I make this apple into a musical instrument? 
  -Where did the apple come from?
  -How hard do I have to throw it against the ground before it will split into pieces?

  After ten to fifteen questions are created, we will work as a class to explore the answers to two or three of these questions.  We will not necessarily be looking for direct answers.  Instead, we will be asking ourselves, “If I were to answer this question, how would I do so?”  For example, if the class were to choose the question, “What kinds of animals eat the apple?”, then we might suggest that a person first examine where the apple came from and then study the animals that live in the habitat.  After we have performed this task as a class, I would ask each student to come up with an interesting object.  Then, the students would pair up, trade objects and repeat the question-answer process.  This would end the first portion of the class.

  In the second portion of the class, we would discuss as a class the effects of the exercise we performed.  In particular, I would ask the class to think about:

  -What questions appealed to you?
  -Do you see any pattern in the questions you were attracted to?
  -Do some of these questions bother you/motivate you/ make you want to take action?

  The goal of these questions is for the students to discover and understand what “lens” they see the world through.  Are they looking at the world through a mathematical perspective, a musical perspective, a medicinal perspective, an artistic perspective?

  The third part of the class would then be devoted to encouraging the students to take action.  I don’t know a great way to say this in English, but there is a great Japanese word for this: 活かせる.  Essentially, I would want the students to realize that the way they see world is different from everyone else, and that they should not let their unique perspective wither and die.

  To conclude the class, I would ask the students to recall the apple example that we started the class with.  In particular, I would point them to the question, “Can I make this apple into a musical instrument” and show them the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQuH8g8LrOw&feature=channel&list=UL.  After watching the video, I would finish the class by concluding that like the man in the video, we should all, in some aspect of our lives, devote ourselves to our passions and our unique view of the world.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Jesse Schreck<br/>Yale College<br/>Junior<br/>jesse.schreck@yale.edu</td><td>I remember talking to Kenta last year, when he was in the earliest stages of planning GAKKO. Watching the 2012 team come together, even from afar, it was clear that GAKKO is a pretty incredible organization built on a pretty incredible idea. Creating an educational summer camp gives people the opportunity not only to teach, but to challenge and refine their own ideas about teaching. I would love to be a part of the process.</td><td>Playwriting in New York. By 2022 I want to have a show going up off-Broadway, with a couple promising projects in the works. Maybe a TV pilot. Maybe some meetings lined up with potential producers in Los Angeles. I want to be set in my career as a creative writer.</td><td>Playwriting: Voice and Craft</td><td>Gertrude Stein once famously said that, between Matisse and Picasso, Matisse was the better painter, but Picasso was the better artist. In her estimation, art can be broken down into two main elements: voice—or the artist's vision—and craft, the mechanics by which that vision is articulated. Both components are necessary for the creation of great art. Without craft, the vision is inexpressible; without voice, there is nothing to express.

  Too often, creative writing classes focus on one of these components at the expense of the other. Either you swim in pseudo-therapy designed to help you discover your inner voice, or you sit through dry lectures on dramatic principles—the "event" of the play, the arc, lines that subtly shift a scene's power dynamics—as if great playwriting could be distilled into a set of mechanical processes.

  I don't think it's necessary to divorce voice and craft in order to teach them. I would spend the first third of my class on voice, working with students to discover what it is they want to communicate in their writing. But then I would spend the rest of our time integrating a pedagogy of craft into the development of voice. I would work with students to find the appropriate tools to express their specific ideas—a piece of documentary theater, for example, might demand direct address, whereas a history piece would require stylized language. This class would be unique—and uniquely effective—because craft would be taught toward a specific, personal end. It would be tailored, as it should be, for the expression of voice.

  By the end of the course, each student will have a piece of creative writing in which form mirrors substance. In the process, the students will learn not merely how to write plays, but how to express themselves artistically. They will be forced to confront their beliefs in order to articulate them. They may discover new beliefs, or they may become more grounded in the beliefs they already held. Either way, students will leave the class with a firmer grasp of who they are as playwrights, as artists, and as people.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><br/>Yale<br/>Freshman <br/>luciaherrmann22@gmail.com</td><td>I first heard about the program through Florian Koenigsberger who participated in the program’s inaugural year. What really fascinated me was how he stressed that the students were all very engaged and interested in learning about things not traditionally taught in the classroom. 

  Upon learning more about the program, I am very interested in what I believe is a positive influence in an area that crucially needs reformation. The education system, from what I can see in my home state of Florida, has ceased to be one that generates innovators. Rather, students are pushed through the system, with emphasis on teaching kids how to master a simplistic “Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test” that in essence limits the classroom environment. Personally, I went through the public education system until my freshman year of high school as I was learning about Venn diagram’s in my English class at the expense of having interesting discussion on literary sources and learning from my teacher and peers. 

  How is it that we can expect the global issues at hand to be solved if we are not teaching students how to expand their minds and learn, not only from their classroom sources, but from the people who surround them and through conscientious reflection? As times have changed, the academic emphasis has shifted from developing creativity and ingenuity to “how can I master the next big standardized test before me?” In higher education, the traditional modes of teaching through lectures and participatory environments that allow students to display their creative, research or literary strengths are being replaced by purely online learning with limited possibility for meaningful interactions. I believe that the only way to create an upcoming generation of innovators and creative thinkers is to create an active learning environment in the classroom that allows students to teach and learn from their peers. Hopefully, from there students can take this active perspective and embody it through an unwavering dedication to learning to reach their highest capacity.  </td><td>To be completely honest, I’m not sure what I’ll be doing in 10 years. When I first got to Yale, I had the idea of majoring in biomedical engineering (possibly with a double-major in philosophy) and eventually working at a drug-manufacturing company or some sort of global company that works to reduce the negative medical effects resulting from limited access to clean water. After one semester, I am now also really interested in urban architecture and cognitive science/research. Maybe in ten years I’ll have been through engineering graduate school or applied to medical school or be teaching or researching something brain-related. I’m really not sure, but that’s okay!  I still have some time to figure it out and make my future a bit more tangible.  </td><td>Challenges to Developing Emotional Intelligence in Modern Day Society</td><td>What is emotional intelligence? Why is it so important in our daily lives and quotidian interactions? In what way has emotional intelligence been represented in the past and how are the manifestations of emotional intelligence changing in modern day society in relation to technology and other advancements? 

  The aim of the class would be to teach students the importance of understanding one’s own emotions so as to foster better relationships with others. This topic has been explored in the past by authors and cinematographers alike and would use literary references such as A Hero of Our Time (Lermontov), Mrs. Dalloway (Woolf) and movies like Godard’s Two or Three Things I Know About Her. Using such references, the class would explore how characters develop an understanding of themselves while also asking readers/watchers to question what they hold to be true about themselves and their relations to others. The importance of developing a strong human connection would ultimately be emphasized. 

  With modern day technology and advancements, it would seem that this human connection and understanding of oneself is being lost, or at the very least, changing. How does the omnipresence of emails, text messages, Facebook, Skype, and other technological facets of modern society change the way we connect? Does it make us less likely to develop the skills necessary to engage in understanding ourselves or to form a human connection with those in our immediate surroundings? Or does this new technology open our world to let us develop a connection to people cross-culturally? The class would be discussion based with exercises that have students assess their own understanding of self and rethink their daily social interactions/how to possibly improve them.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Claire Donnelley<br/>Yale University<br/>Junior<br/>Claire.donnelley@yale.edu</td><td>I grew up with unconventional schooling. I remember playing hooky (which I thought was a game separate from skipping school) to collect leaves, work in the garden, pick out weird-looking foods from the Berkeley Bowl, or even learn about archeology by helping excavate dinosaurs with my dad and sister in South Dakota. When I was in 3rd grade, my mother took me and my sister out of school entirely in favor of home-schooling. I think back on those years as being inventive, spontaneous, and entirely without structure. I pursued what interested me. One month I was interested in Greek myths and reading the Odyssey, the next I was a chemist, creating nitrogen triiodide in my backyard and blowing up coke bottles with Mentos. My pursuits may have been capricious, but although I may have missed out on some math and geography, I entered high school a free thinker with a firm foundation in creativity. I enjoyed high school, but my experience fit many of the stereotypes of an institution: classes were easy for me, I wasn’t inspired, (except by a few teachers), and I often felt like I was wasting my time. While this may have been a symptom of my 4000-person public high school, it seemed like such a shame that I or anyone else should have to spend six hours of their day going through the motions of learning something that could have taken much less time to learn on my own. There also seems to exist in many schools a generally-accepted dislike of the institution. I remember thinking that it must be a learned dislike that develops over many years, that maybe people just got tired of following a similar school routine by the time they reached high school. However, even the 6-year-olds I taught during summer camp who were fascinated by redwood trees, caterpillars, boats, (literally what felt like everything), already expressed a dislike for school. Thus, in my roundabout way, GAKKO interests me because it challenges the idea that school should be conventional and offers alternatives to learning that allow school to be fun and creative. I wish that school could be built on the belief that great ideas should be shared rather than being built on the belief that knowledge must be imparted merely because it must be done. I don't think people should have to wait until college to have original ideas and be told they can pursue whatever interests them. I hope that in the future anyone and everyone will be excited about school. I think GAKKO is a great program designed to make that happen, and I would love to be a part of it. </td><td>My immediate plans are to take a year or two off after college to look for an internship (preferably abroad) in which I hope to discover who I am as a person outside of the context of school. Afterwards I hope to attend medical school, then ideally spend some time working for Doctors Without Borders, or a similar organization that brings clinicians to understaffed locations--malaria endemic regions being my current area of interest. I hope that by putting myself into many different environments, I will discover where I fit best as a clinician in our society today. Armed with that knowledge, I’ll strive to make the changes I can to make my little niche in the world the best it can be. In terms of character, I hope that I will have the self-confidence to stick to my morals, enough variety of experience that I can interact with many different kinds of people, and the humility to understand life to be an ongoing education.  </td><td>Under the Surface</td><td>My class is about discovering the hidden layers of everyday objects. The class would require light microscopes and wet slide preparation materials. It would be divided into two main sections: collection/preparation and observation. I would start the class off by having students collect things that they find interesting: a leaf, a flake of skin, a piece of dust...anything at all. I would hope to take the class on a “collection walk” where they could pick up anything that looked interesting. We would then prepare the slides for observation, I would give a brief technique lesson on how to use a microscope, and the observations would begin. The purpose of the class is to see the microscopic beauty of mundane things. Something like an onion slice becomes a geometer’s dream with its many organized segments and cell partitions; a scraping from a tongue can show the miniature movements of ribosomes or active transport--showing us the busyness of our own body that happens without any conscious effort. I hope that students will come away with a newfound fascination and appreciation for the enormity of impact that unseeable things can have on our life. I would hope to conclude with a discussion of some of the small things I find most fascinating in our world: ebola virus--what it looks like, how big it is, and what it can do to a person; the role of ants in maintaining our ecosystem; the lifecycle of a malarial parasite; or the power of our immune system--the miniature battles that occur every minute between white blood cells and pathogens. I hope that students leave in awe of the complexity and beauty of the world around us believing that even the smallest things can often have the greatest impact. </td></tr>

In ninth grade, my school (as part of education reform) had a class where, in groups of five, we designed our own schools, both the curriculum and the architecture. It was supposed to engage us artistically and philosophically, but it generally led to us rethinking about school, what we liked and didn't like int he current system and how we could change what we disliked. This led to my general interest in education reform, which grew with every book about education I read in that class, from modern reform-geared books, to some of the oldest classics, such as Rabelais' Gargantua.

  The class plan was structured very simply, with two mini-lectures and a big guided discussion using multi-media information. 

  Lecture 1 (10 mins): 
  Introductory clip from Tarzan (Disney). The common established psychology that man is superior to animals. Jane Goodall and her story (basic biography, and extract of her book on redefining man). The basic physiological similarities between humans and their closest living link: chimpanzees (things we share (eukaryotes, vertebrates, tetrapods, amniotic, mammals, primates, genetic similarity), and what we don’t (skull shape and size, biped). 

  Discussion (45 mins): 
  In groups for twenty mins discussing what, on a philosophical level differentiates us from chimpanzees, with the following guiding questions: 
  If you disregard physical appearance, what differentiates a human from a chimpanzee? 
  Which of these characteristics can be applied to all other animals and therefore define mankind?
  If the discussion is having trouble happening, these other more specific guiding questions: 
  What differentiates chimpanzee and human communication? 
  Is culture and art unique to man? 
  Is temporality unique to man?  

  Next twenty five mins 
  Going through the groups one by one assembling a list of defining human characteristics, if it happens, allowing debate between groups. The main points tend to be language, culture, art, tools, intelligence, creativity, notion of temporality, complex societies and love (or monogamous, long-length relationships).  Then going through and, using YouTube videos (chimpanzee communication, art and intelligence) and extracts and pictures from Jane Goodall’s book (societies, love, tools) disproving most of the points. Realizing there is little that distinguishes humans and chimpanzees, except the chimpanzee incapability to project itself far in time and its incapability of expressing abstract notions in words.

  Conclusions: what this should mean for our everyday lives. Thoughts on animal abuse, animal testing, destruction of the environment and biodiversity. Questions. 


  What I love about this class is that, for the most part, students actually come to the conclusions themselves. In my plan, I have just exposed all should be said, but not by me. Since most people know things, both about themselves, and about animals, the process of finding differences isn’t too difficult. And, not to quote Inception, but ideas one forms on one’s own are much more powerful than one imposed by, for example, a teacher. Also, this class should lead to outside discussion, solely by its provocative nature. It should provoke (or at least did at my school) renewed interest in environmental causes. It also teaches students about key philosophical notions, such as language, art and culture while providing biological, anthropological and historical information. The class also encourages public speaking in the form of the debates and should spur rethinking of our lifestyles, while humbling us philosophically.

  <tr><td>Peter Simpson Wyckoff<br/>Yale University<br/>Freshman <br/>peter.wyckoff@yale.edu</td><td>Past experimentation in teaching, as well as projects around education reform made me interested in Gakko. 

  I am Franco-American, so as I grew up I spent a lot of time in between the two countries. This led to my initial interest in education reform, seeing what we could take from the French system to improve the American one, and vice versa. 
  In ninth grade, my school (as part of an educational reform) introduced a class where in groups of five, we designed our own schools, both the curriculum and the architecture.The main purpose was to meld art and philosophy, but we just went wild with it, spending hours every week debating every part of our new school. We also participated in a project to create a “New Jr. High School” (“Nouveau collège”), where we gave student feedback on an adult project. 
  I look back now and think that a lot of my ideas were destined to fail, but, what was more important about the class was that it empowered us to believe that we could change the education system. This led to my sizeable interest in education reform, which grew with every book about education we read in that class, from modern reform-geared books, to some of the oldest classics, such as Rabelais' Gargantua. 
  Since then, I became a teacher for two years at the Roaming SchoolHouse in Paris, where I taught after-school English to primary and middle school-level children. I also became the coordinator of the roots & shoots Jane Goodall Institute Program for Youth in France. Both of these experiences led me to believe that the teachers one has, and the education one receives at a very young age truly shape your life. This is one of my major motivations for becoming a teacher and for Gakko. 
  Lastly, last summer, I also participated in the Meisei University Summer School Program in Hino (near Tokyo), where I volunteered for two weeks. This program’s aim seemed quite similar to Gakko’s, attempting educational reform on a small-scale basis, though its main focus was that of teaching English as a Second Language.

  <tr><td>Julie Chang<br/>Harvard College<br/>Sophomore<br/>haeunchang@college.harvard.edu</td><td>I have always been interested in Japan and Japanese culture since high school. While taking four years of the language in high school, I grew to have an appreciation for the people and traditions of Japan. However, I do see that there is a problem in the Japanese school system (similarly to Korean school systems) with too much of a focus on rote memorization and recitation. I have a vested interest in education, and have experience teaching many different subjects - from music theory, piano and violin, English, school subjects, etc - and would love the opportunity to bring a new form of thinking and way of looking at education and learning to students who may not have been exposed to such a method in the past. I know that it was a shock to me when I came to college and so many of my classes were discussion based, and teachers constantly asked us what our opinions and thoughts were on the topic at hand. It was empowering and gave me the confidence to think critically about issues and speak up about my thoughts. I think that that is what we need to do in our classrooms today.</td><td>I have a passion for public health, and I see myself working in an NGO working on strengthening health systems and communities. I also see myself devoted to music and the arts, and perhaps even still teaching and volunteering to serve underprivileged kids who don't have access to the arts.</td><td>Issues in Global Health</td><td>Issues in global health as we know it today are more of a conglomeration of what seem to be impossibly complex problems with no solution at hand. From a lack of water security in the Horn of Africa, to the prevalence of MDR-TB in Russia, to the malaria and AIDS epidemics around the world, these problems can seem too large for individuals to be able to do anything about it. 

  However, by looking at past examples of success, such as the campaign to eradicate polio, and at current models of success, like the work that Partners in Health do in Haiti, Rwanda, and all over the world, we can learn what those successful models have in common and propose our own solutions to these problems. 

  By looking at global health issues through a series of different lens - from the social perspective to the biological facts, from the economic and financial to the governmental and political, we can learn the tools to take these immense problems and break them down into issues that we can solve, one at a time.

  It is my hope that through this class, students will be able to use the critical and multilateral thinking necessary to deal with these global health problems and be able to apply them to other areas of interest, giving them the tools to develop their own solutions to problems that others may say are impossible.

(Seriously, some good design going on there). </td><td>20% chance: spectacularly successful entrepreneur, married to a dazzling woman, philosophizing about some political theory while working on renovating an old car.

  80% chance: unemployed under a bridge with my (literal) hood rat friends.  </td><td>On being a market maker</td><td>The game that starts the class is a classic one used in Sales and Trading training.  The students are asked a difficult factual question--for example, how long was the Tour de France in 2012 in km?   A few students are asked to be "market makers" for a security whose intrinsic value is the answer to that question, which means they have to take a best guess and offer values at which they would buy and sell that security to the market.  (e.g., one student might buy it at 2500, sell it at 3000; another student might buy at 2900, sell at 3500; another student might buy it at 3300, sell it at 4000).    Other students then can discuss how they would trade given the existence of those market makers.  A few might see the arbitrage opportunity to buy at 3000 and sell at 3300 for riskless profit.  Others will trade according to their intuition.  In the end, the answer is revealed (3,497 km) and people are awarded points based upon how much they would have made if the trades were real.  

  The game is meant to teach the basic idea of what makes a person successful in any market.  With iterations of the game, it eventually becomes clear that "fair value" of a commodity doesn't exist--value is perceived, not intrinsic.  Value can be understood by understanding people, not items.  To reinforce this concept, students can be asked how they would value an axe.  They should answer that to a lot of people, its completely worthless, but to a carpenter it could be worth millions. To some people in the middle it could be worth several thousand yen. The item has no distinct value but is always shaped by those people. Thus a good "market maker" understands the people surrounding her, rather than knowing the item itself.  By understanding how an item will affect everyone around her, she can make a clear estimation of its "value."  

  So what's the larger philosophical application of this idea?  One the students are solid about the basic concept, they are asked in the later half of the class are to discuss "value" in settings increasingly abstracted from the numerical realm.  First, some students are asked to think about items they might find valueless.  They are asked to consider in what situations those things might be valuable to others.  This section naturally leads into a discussion of the "dumpster diving" approach to entrepreneurship, which seeks to merely "unlock" hidden value in items deemed to have low value.

  Secondly, students are asked about the value of abstract concepts, like "education."  From this model, they should know that education has no intrinsic value by itself, which might confirm all their latent suspicions.  It indeed has no inherent value, but students should be asked why education might be valued by their parents, their government, their future children, and finally themselves.  This also naturally segues into a pep talk of how they should make education valuable to themselves, rather than waiting on someone else to do it for them.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Alexander J Saeedy<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>alexander.saeedy@yale.edu</td><td>A good friend of mine, Nathaniel, participated in GAKKO last summer. Before he had left and told me about the program, I have to admit that I was at first skeptical . To "question education" seemed altogether too vague and nebulous to me--wasn't the point of getting an education some kind of intellectual enrichment that would aid us as we grew older and became everyday members of society? This is at least how I saw education last year and for most of my childhood, in which I, call me point X, was travelling towards a point Y, which I defined as success and happiness. 

  But something happened this year. Point Y became less and less defined and I suddenly found myself "learning" a great deal but equally unsure as to what I was supposed to do with what I've learned. And while this has happened, I've come to several questions I'd never thought I'd ask myself: Why am I learning? Why is it important to go to school and learn more? Is there a specific goal or end towards which I should apply this knowledge? Is pure intellectual interest superior to practical ability?

  I still don't have the answers to these questions yet, although I've been trying to explore them and what they mean over the past months, GAKKO appears to me as a way for me to experiment and play with these questions of learning, knowledge, and education through the creation of an educational program and a questioning of the boundaries of teacher/student. GAKKO not only asks the right questions about what it means to teach, and to know, but it decontextualizes it from the American perspective and approaches a multi-national and multi-cultural perspective. I’m currently enrolled in a class on 19th century Japanese history, and we’ve studied in detail their approach to academics and state education. Actually visiting Japan, thinking about the influence of institutionalized education, and coming into contact with Japanese students would particular put “education,” whatever it may mean, in a new light for me. 
  </td><td>2. The question of the ages. I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. I've certainly played around with the idea of going into academia and become a professor of some kind. I've grown a strong love/hate for the humanities over my time at Yale (I'm currently a History and Philosophy major) and I can easily imagine myself teaching full-time at a university someday. But I'm equally unsure about this ambition, and I'm worried about going into a profession which asks more questions than it provides answers. I've also considered a career in law, appealing to my social side as opposed to my bookish stay-in-the-library-until-3-AM side. But I also question my real motives for going into law, and the difference in between my perception of law (thank you primetime TV) and the profession as it really exists. 

  So, in short, I'm not really sure.
  </td><td>History as Concept</td><td>3. A student of history is generally taught the following: Before some event A, conditions X, Y, & Z existed. The historical implications of X, Y, & Z were necessary causes of event A. 

  How accurate is such an understanding of history? If we argue that this model is correct, then how can we satisfactorily know what the conditions for historical change are? Are there certain conditions or moments in history which are more important than others, and if so, why? 
  Furthermore, does history exist as a linear dialectic surrounding a particular concept (i.e. Marx and capital, Foucault and sexuality), or is a wider consortium of unrelated events that unexpectedly coincide? Does/can history repeat itself?

  These questions, as vague as they appear, underlie nearly all understandings of history. Were I to teach this class, I would want to focus on a "major" moment in history, such as the English Civil War or the French Revolution, and examine the many ways in which such a moment in history can be "known" or understood. I am currently enrolled in HIST 303, Japan’s Modern Revolution, and we engaged in such a study of an important moment in 19th century Japanese history, the Meiji Restoration. In most cases, the Meiji Restoration appears to be a straightforward and comprehensible historical event: the presence of strong Western forces that threatened to overthrow the existing political institutions sparked a surge of political centralization that would culminate in the restoration of the emperor as Japan’s absolute sovereign. But already this theory has its problems—how did the growing economy of Japan add to the political unrest of the 1850s? How did the growing role of women and their connection to kokugaku, the study of ancient Japan, reshape understandings of the Japanese nation? And furthermore, did the ambitions of particular historical actors in the pre-Meiji government influence the restoration of 1867? In a paper I wrote regarding this problem, entitled Questioning the Master Narrative, I addressed the largely inconclusive nature of particular and focused narratives of history, but later addressed the impossibility of a “master narrative” in history. 

  In my opinion, history extends far beyond the textbook—it shapes who we are and who we will become. As such, understanding history is a way of understanding ourselves. Through an examination of “what is history,” I think we come to a much more important question: “who are we?” This class would ideally explore the link in between the two, and the difficulties of establishing a concrete history that seeks to wholly classify a moment or an era of time. Further questions I’d like to explore include the disjunction of the individual and the whole, and the problems of subjective, cultural, and chronological bias.

  (This would probably be a long class, but the questions are well worth the time to investigate, in my opinion.)

  <tr><td>Jacob Effron<br/>Yale College<br/>Senior <br/>jacob.effron@yale.edu</td><td>     My interest in Gakko originated from a conversation I had with Nate Toppelberg about the program.  Nate and I were both part of a democratic learning program at our high school called School Within a School (SWS).  From what he told me, it sounded like through Gakko Nate was able to help spread the SWS way of thinking.
       SWS challenged the typical way subjects were taught in high school; I took classes on identity and race, creative writing and childhood and memory.  We called our teachers by their first names and most of our learning came from discussions and editing sessions led by peers.  SWS really opened my eyes to how meaningful learning can be when it truly taps into the passions of all students in the classroom.  Its emphasis on learning from each other has affected the way I learn to this day.  
       It's an exciting prospect for me to join an organization whose mission is to spread this way of learning.  Especially since it involves teaching, something I've enjoyed doing since I taught remedial summer school math throughout high school.  Given what I've briefly heard about the Japanese school system, it seems like this program provides a real benefit.  And I like the idea of taking part of the whole process from planning to execution.    
  </td><td>     I want to be involved in writing or implementing either healthcare or education policy.  Hopefully I will be able to bring some on-the-ground experience from having previously worked in either industry.  I strongly believe that it is essential to make these programs run more effectively and efficiently; otherwise as the welfare states grows people will feel that their tax dollars are going to waste and strongly resist revenue increases.  Having worked in government for two summers while at Yale I am confident that it provides the kind of stimulation and impact I am looking for.  </td><td>Thinking About Public Policy</td><td>     The welfare state has come under attack from all sides as debt levels have increased in developed countries throughout the world.  Over the next decades, difficult choices will have to be made about the size of the state, and what criteria it should use to decide what it funds.  These decisions raise fundamental questions about the role of government that makes for fascinating and important discussion.  High school students are rarely given the chance to step back from memorizing dates, systems of government or what other people thought to ponder what they believe about the big questions concerning the role of the state: what obligations does the government have to citizens and how should that change if at all based on their age and life choices (to work, do drugs etc.)?  Should the government value the well-being of all equally?  What should the difference be in the amount of taxes people of varying wealth pay?
       We will start off exploring these questions broadly before diving into some specific case studies of real policy issues in the Western world that drive home the difficulties of answering these questions.  We will look at welfare policy, healthcare and taxation.  Should welfare be different for those working and those not, addicts and non-addicts?  Is there a point at which the government should stop paying for healthcare costs and how do you determine that point?  Much of the discussion will be focused on determining what sub-questions follow from our larger questions and trying to flush out the fundamental issues at stake.  At the end, as students begin to develop their views I will leverage my experience as a debater to help students think about best articulating their ideas and work on their public speaking.  The goal would be to have each student present his thoughts about one of our specific case studies to a larger group.    
       There are no right answers to these questions and the goal is not to arrive at any conclusion.  Rather, I hope that through discussion we can spur thinking about difficult questions that continues long after the students leave the classroom and drives further conversations among them.  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Linda Trujano<br/>Harvard College<br/>Sophomore<br/>lindatrujano@college.harvard.edu</td><td>I was lucky enough to participate in a Spring Break trip to Beijing this year in which we taught English to middle school students who are the kids of migrant workers. It was a wonderful experience and now I am part of the Executive Board in charge of planning next year's trip. It was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life and I came back a totally different person. Then I decided to apply for HSYLC and also got in and this time we went to Shanghai to teach seminars to high school students. I taught a seminar called "Dancing Your Way Into Happiness" and the students absolutely loved it. They loved talking about happiness, self-confidence, and goal-setting and they also really enjoyed learning different dance moves. I believe that GAKKO is fairly similar to these two programs and I just really love having the opportunity to expand my cultural horizons and learning a new culture, having the ability to influence students' lives in a very positive way and establishing ever-lasting friendships.
  </td><td>After college I plan on getting a doctorate degree in Psychology and becoming a psychologist who specializes in teenagers. Therefore in ten years I see myself practicing psychology and holding seminars for people who want to increase their happiness and self-confidence. In addition to being a psychologist I see myself being a motivational speaker who travels around the world inspiring people to be happy and to reach the best of their abilities. Also I see myself happily married and raising a wonderful family. </td><td>Dancing Your Way Into Happiness</td><td>Every single person in the world, regardless of gender, race, or age desires to have happiness as an ingredient that can potentially help create the recipe of a life filled with gratitude, love, and, confidence. A myriad of books have explored secret ingredients that are necessary to achieve an ineffable state of peace; a special state of bliss in which we feel connected to the world around us, and most importantly, to ourselves. 
  The secret recipe of happiness needs to be shared with teenagers worldwide. It is intriguing to find how across the globe, people place different values and definitions on this emotion, and it is even more interesting to know that renowned psychologists, psychiatrists, and philosophers have found compelling facts about such an un-measurable variable. 
  In order to satisfy students’ hunger for knowledge about this topic, the seminar will discuss techniques, skills, and secrets that had been revealed thanks to research from renowned psychologists, psychiatrists, and philosophers worldwide.  For example, students will explore Marci Shimoff's Happy for No Reason, a best-seller book equipped with famous quotes by philosophers, unbelievable stories, and spellbinding experiments. 
  A seminar about the secret to happiness will be extremely beneficial to Japanesel students not only because it will increase their self-confidence, but also because they will start to see problem that arise as learning opportunities. This Happy Seminar is bound enable students to look at life through a positive perspective, and ultimately, to achieve and experience their own kind of realistic fairytale .

  <tr><td>Jim Liu<br/>Yale College<br/>Senior <br/>jim.liu@yale.edu</td><td>Gakko's mission to reexamine and question the fundamentals of learning resonates deeply with me. 

  Along with a rock star team, I founded ReadySetLaunch (www.readysetlaunch.org), a nonprofit that gives low-income high school students free college counseling. The consistency in the hundreds of answers that we have received to our simple question for prospective mentees, "why is going to college important to you?" at first raised no question or concern in me. The prevailing narrative over four years’ worth of responses was that the successful access to and passage over a series of academic hurdles entitles one to future prosperity. Indeed, this is the narrative that the current education reform movement implicitly endorses by its emphasis on student achievement, the metrics behind passage over the hurdles. This is also the narrative that I operated under in high school when I held a single-minded focus to do whatever it takes for admission into an elite college. 

  I gradually came to find this instrumental and narrowly focused approach to learning that pervades across class and geography deeply troubling.  Some of the lessons that have left the deepest impressions upon me over the last few years did not fit into the hurdle narrative. Many occurred far away from the classroom and the usual commitments of a student. Just last night, I stopped in my rush to get home and finish a paper due at midnight to help an old lady cross Elm Street. Our interaction and conversation made me think deeply about aging, loneliness, and poverty.  Last week, I postponed preparing for a final presentation to chat with my roommate who has been swamped by work. Hearing about a statistical methodology he was using in a paper led me to completely restructure my presentation and craft much more defensible conclusions. The hurdle narrative minimizes the odds of chance, nontraditional learning opportunities that expose us to various perspectives and insights. Having a single-minded focus on overcoming the next hurdle sometimes stunts the growth of the whole self and inhibits creative problem solving. As I scrutinize the hurdles laid out in front of myself and continue to help our mentees over theirs, the holes in current visions of a good education become more and more apparent. 

  I have no doubt that grit and focus are absolutely essential in the learning process. The questions of what guides and what should guide those forces in each individual are what excite me the most. My conversations with Nate and Ben convinced me that I will find a community of learning at Gakko. I can’t wait. 
  </td><td>My final assignment for perhaps the most influential class of my Yale career, “Schools, Community, and the Teacher,” was to create a proposal for a charter school that I would enroll my own children in. The name that I settled upon for my school was “Eudemonia Academy”, derived from the Ancient Greek concept of “human flourishing” at the core of Aristotelian ethics. The mandate of the school was twofold. Firstly, the school would empower students with necessary fundamentals and a wide knowledge base so that students can discover their own paths of learning. Secondly, the school would expose students to a variety of social issues and push them to build their own moral frameworks that encompass others to guide present and future decision making. The ultimate goal was for students to thrive socially, emotionally, and intellectually while working to ensure that others in the world can do the same. 

  I can think of nothing more rewarding and important than continuing to evolve my vision for what learning and education should be. Whether I’m working at an education startup, teaching at a school, or managing a charter school network, I see myself bringing pieces of my ideal education institution to life in 10 years. 
  </td><td>Our Emotional Selves</td><td>“The degree of one's emotions varies inversely with one's knowledge of the facts.”
  - Bertrand Russell, Logician and Philosopher

  “Your intellect may be confused, but your emotions will never lie to you.”
  -Robert Ebert, Film Critic and Pulitzer Prize Winner

  The question of what role emotions should play in everyday decision making has historically divided a number of great thinkers. However, few would refute the importance of emotions to everyday human life. The lives of high school students enjoy no special emotional immunity. In fact, socio-emotional development accelerates during secondary schooling with the central sphere of daily activities continuing to shift outside of the home. Increased social contact and external pressures in high school expose many students to confusing and potentially disruptive emotional experiences. Romantic obsession in early intimate interactions and deep disappointment upon failure to reach a self-identified goal are common first experiences in this lifestage. 

  The intensity and novelty of emotional experiences for high school students make their abilities to recognize, understand, and manage their emotions especially important. Some educators and psychologists subscribe to this logic and are extending beyond the focus on academic achievement to develop methods that nurture the whole student. There are existing and empirically tested methods in this space that produce results in primary and secondary schooling environments. One set of these methods, entitled “The RULER Approach”, is currently being incubated in Yale’s own Edward Zigler Center in Child Development & Social Policy. RULER stands for Recognition, Understanding, Labeling, Expression, and Regulation and embodies the key elements of the social emotional learning (SEL) movement. According to a 2006 study published in Education Psychologist, meta-analyses of school-based programming based on various implementations of SEL enhanced mental health and improved test scores. Another recent Yale Study co-authored by President Salovey shows marked gains in student achievement and collaboration from application of emotions based approaches among 1400 middle school students. SEL is an important piece of the puzzle for building emotional intelligence. 

  To delve into the concrete, the class proposed might start with icebreakers to prepare participants for a discussion on very intimate topics. Then the Sempai could proceed to share some difficult but relatable emotional experiences and subsequent actions, focusing on the processes of emotional understanding and regulation to give the discussion structure and momentum. The discussion would then open up to the entire group and be free of judgment so that kohai would be comfortable sharing honestly. The group would then analyze some of the SEL oriented methodologies currently being implemented and apply one set of these methodologies to real life case studies. The group would then push beyond current research and practice. Sempai and kohai could critically assess SEL methodologies on their implicit desired outcomes and long term effects beyond the results reported in empirical studies. Finally, the group could end with summarizing transformative takeaways, synthesizing some strategies that kohai could implement immediately in their daily lives, and generating some lingering questions that kohai and sempai can continue to explore.

  <tr><td>Rory Marsh<br/>Yale College<br/>Senior <br/>rdwmarsh@gmail.com</td><td>After my sophomore year of high school, I attended a leadership conference that deeply inspired me and redefined my life goals. The teachers and mentors I found there showed me things that I hadn’t found in high school. The conference lasted a week and a half; the inspiration still hasn’t faded. I believe strongly in the potential of powerful experiences. I believe in the ability of passionate teachers to make a lasting impact and leave a lasting impression. And I believe that GAKKO offers a unique opportunity for college students to activate young minds and broaden horizons. It is for this reason that I’m applying to teach in 2013.

  I’ve long had a passion for teaching and mentoring. In high school, I spent my summers leading a wilderness camp at the local nature preserve and supporting children with neuromuscular disorders. During the school year, I tutored other students of all ages in preparation for standardized testing. Here at Yale, I’ve built upon those experiences as a FOOT leader and an English teacher for refugee families. I’ve always found these experiences to go both ways: I learn as much from my students as they learn from me. When I first heard about GAKKO from previous participants, I immediately saw an opportunity to continue that learning process and engage in an enriching cultural exchange. I was instantly excited.

  GAKKO also offers an incredible opportunity to explore Japanese culture, which has long fascinated me. I am an American student who studies Chinese language and society; as such, I find that my two cultural hubs – the US and China – both define themselves in opposition to Japan. I would love to go beyond the stereotypes and superficial understandings and explore the true soul of Japan. Visiting the country and interacting with program participants would allow me to do this.

  Finally, I am drawn to GAKKO for the chance to learn from my peers here at Yale. As a soon-to-be second semester senior, I’m very conscious of the fleeing moments that remain among such a colorful group of individuals. I believe GAKKO can bring out the best in them, showcasing their passions and fostering their creativity. And I would love to be there for those moments of inspiration, learning from them just as their students will, soaking in the spirit of youthful intellectual enthusiasm. 
  </td><td>Just a few days ago, I was asked this very same question by one of my professors here at Yale.  I replied that in ten years time, I hope to have found my great idea – a piece of creativity or a cause that I want to pour my soul into.  There are a hundred and one things that I feel passionate about: expanding the reach of societal empathy, combating climate change, or changing the way the Western world thinks about its just dessert. Yet, are anything of these things that one idea that I can dedicate myself to, like Woodrow Wilson’s internationalism or Marie Curie’s radioactivity? I’m not yet sure. Nonetheless, I believe firmly in the power of big ideas, as well as the importance of living life for a greater purpose. And so I’ll continue searching for my idea – in ten years, I hope to have pinned down its shadow, at the very least.
  	
  I don’t believe that any career should follow a linear path, and I don’t intend to lay one out for myself. In years past, I’ve worked in refugee resettlement, studied in China, and represented the US government in France. Next year, I’ll be consulting for McKinsey. My path will continue wandering, if I know myself well enough. My driving motivation is to enrich my skills, build my experience, and expand my knowledge. So I continue to seek out the greatest challenges I can find. I hope to see and experience as much of the world as I can. In ten years time, I will most certainly still be exploring.
   	
  I also enjoy living my life in pursuit of numerous different goals; this will surely not have changed within ten years. I will still be training for athletic competitions, learning new instruments, and making new friends. I will be enjoying life’s greatest simple pleasures: coffee, rainy days in spring, and great conversations. Hopefully, I will also be building a family. In ten years, I will still be living life, trying to live it to the fullest. With a little bit of luck, I will also have found my idea, and started to outline a path to making it a reality.
  </td><td>Making the right choice: strategic decision making for gaming and life</td><td>Strategic decision making is essential in numerous fields, from biology to finance. How does one respond to the choices of others? Going one step further, how does one think about how others are thinking? This is game theory, a simple and yet profoundly important field of economic thought. Its applications in our daily life are many, and tremendous amounts of fun can be had in exploring even the simplest of lessons. Given the chance to be a high school teacher for one day, I would teach decision theory – and hope to leave my students energized and inspired to approach daily choices with a fresh perspective.

  Throughout the course, I would emphasize interactive and engaging games, such as the one below:

  You are a store owner selling cabbage. You have one competitor, who has a store on the opposite corner. Every month for ten months, you set the price of your cabbage at $1 or $2, as does your competitor. If you choose the same price, you split total sales (and obviously make more money when the price is $2). However, if you set a lower price than your competitor, you capture the whole market and drive your competitor out of business. Play out the game, starting from Month 1.

  Not only do such games encourage students to engage with each other, they also foster a type of hands-on learning which leaves lasting lessons. Moreover, these games have important large-scale practical applications. Why is the cost of Coke and Pepsi exactly the same? Why do credit cards all charge 14% interest on debt? These are questions that have great relevance for our daily lives, but often go overlooked. I would seek to open the eyes of my students to the strategic games that continually play out around them.

  Some of the key themes of my class would include:

  Sunk Cost
  Opportunity Cost
  Prisoner’s Dilemma
  Dictator Game
  Backward Induction
  Signaling

  The teaching methodology would emphasize three distinct phases of learning. First, we would play games in order to experience decision making first hand. Then, I would break down each game to draw out key lessons. Finally, we would seek to apply the lessons to the world around us. How should a soccer player choose the optimal location for his penalty kick? Is there always a best move in a Chess match? These are questions that high-schoolers care about and also have great academic and professional importance. Nonetheless, few high school teachers ever tackle them. I want to change that.

  <tr><td>Joshua Reed Sherman <br/>Kenyon College <br/>Junior<br/>shermanj@kenyon.edu</td><td>I have been interested in GAKKO since last year when I heard Ben Boult and Andrew Nagl rave about the program. At first I thought it would be a free trip to hang out with my friends in Japan but after hearing about their experiences I realized how much more the program meant to them. I think GAKKO has an unbelievable opportunity to reform the way the youth education system is thought about. I think one of the things that frustrated me most throughout high school and even occasionally in college is the monotonous classroom style. Very rarely do Professors and classes diverge from the standard classroom setting. GAKKO sticks out to me because of the questioning of those very educational techniques. People are educated throughout their lives in all different forms and fashions and it intrigues me to attempt to further different techniques for a classroom setting.</td><td>In ten years I am not exactly sure what I will be doing. I have plans to attend graduate school for Religious Studies after I graduate from Kenyon College. However before I go back to school I would like to be able to travel, conduct research, and write. Those are truly my main goals. I want to experience the different cultures and religions of the world. After attending graduate school I would like to be able to continue with my researching and writing. If in ten years I am ready I would like to be a teacher. I would like to teach students about world religions. Eventually I would like to become a scholar and professor of Religious Studies at a college or university. I would love to be an academic. I have so much love and respect for my professors I would like to be able to give back in the same way. </td><td>Defining Religion </td><td>This class would ask the students to define religion for themselves before looking at various definitions of religion from different scholars and historical figures. I would enter the classroom and give the students a blank piece of paper and supplies to write, draw, or make whatever they want with that one piece of paper. I would ask all of the students to find a quiet place outside of the classroom where they could concentrate and really work on their definitions. I would then give the students 15 minutes to write down or draw whatever their own personal definition of religion is. After the exercise we would come back together and see if any students would like to share what they have written/made. I would allow for as many students to share, as the length of the class would allow. The class at this point would become mainly a discussion. I would see if some students had comments on some of the definitions already presented. After giving the students the floor to share their words and creations, I would have a PowerPoint of other definitions of religion given by people such as Freud, Nietzsche, and Durkheim. I would have many more definitions from other cultures as well. I would bring up one definition at a time and ask for the students to have a discussion as to why this definition is a helpful way and also a detrimental way for defining religion. After going through several (maybe around 8 definitions) I would ask the students to take around 5 minutes to change anything about their definitions of religion that they have already created. I would then ask for students to share the changes they made if they did or to explain why they kept their definition the same. I think the goal of this exercise/class is to show the students that religion is important globally and that there are many ways to think about and to define religion and that these definitions are ultimately personal. One definition of religion is not truly superior to the other. Although many of us share similar beliefs, practices, and rituals, this does not mean that our religions are 100 percent the same. Our beliefs are constantly changing throughout our lives depending on what has been shown to us. For example, any student that changed their definition of religion after the discussion or after reading other definitions. It is not that they were wrong before but religion just like most things in life is not static and is constantly evolving for every individual. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Juliana Canfield<br/>Yale University <br/>Junior<br/>juliana.canfield@yale.edu</td><td>First and foremost, I was intrigued by the goals of the project. Namely, the desire to break free from the limiting structure of a traditional rote memorization education system and to replace it with a learning experience based on  conversation, collaboration, and experimentation. As young students, the team members of GAKKO have a unique frame of reference through which they can guide high schoolers while allowing them to derive answers for themselves. 

  The experiences of last year's team is another huge draw for me. Everyone I spoke to about GAKKO 2012 adamantly affirmed the impact the program had for them as well as the students they taught. 

  Lastly, I have wanted to visit Japan since I first saw Big Bird Goes to Japan  at the age 3. This wish has been re-galvanized by the recent GAKKO photos and the mouthwatering Jiro Dreams of Sushi. I cannot think of a better person with whom to visit Japan than Monsieur Koga. </td><td>Acting professionally, writing recreationally, traveling often, cooking well.

  All in the company of dear friends and with the hope that I will be surprised every day. </td><td>Follow the Fear</td><td>A class that, while instructing the students in the basic tenets of improvisation, encourages students to live in the moment and listen to their peers.

  It begins with an exercise in the absurd that asks students to be unabashedly silly in front of one another. It continues with an appeal to the imagination, both personal and collaborative. The games then turn towards the idea of collective story telling through respectful acceptance of another's ideas and productive additions to what is already there. Finally, the class asks students to build a character for themselves within this team-built world, thereby allowing them to discover more acutely their own contributions to it. And finally, a whole-group exercise that ties all of these elements together in a supportive, raucous display of coordination and visual creativity.

  Improv inspires bravery, empathy, and humbleness.

  I realize these descriptions are extremely abstract, but by removing the constructs and "rules" of the individual games from the idea that inspired them, I think it is easier to understand the various, crucial, real-world applications that improvisation can have. </td></tr>

I really enjoyed helping demystify science using a practical approach to learning where students were able to apply the concepts they had learned in class using the Picocricket kit.

  My team and I formed the FabLab Outreach Program (http://fablaboutreach.wordpress.com/) that in the last three years, has inspired 400 students to take up an interest in science and technology by showing how cool and fun they can be.

  I'm looking forward to GAKKO 2013 as another opportunity to interact with high school students in a creative learning environment and help redefine how educational systems should be run.

  </td><td>Ten years from now, I see myself having played a part in reviewing and implementing new policies on the educational system. This will be possible through the continued success of creative and interactive ways of learning by providing the students with the tools needed to help them have a practical, hands-on approach to learning.

  These policies will be carried out by putting in place new platforms and technologies that help inspire new innovations and creations, this way spurring development especially in emerging economies. What I seek to achieve is having an educational system that is not merely an accumulation of knowledge, but a transformation of lives.</td><td>Make It Awesome - Triple AAA : Awesome, Adventurous, Amazing</td><td>Welcome to the Triple A Class for Awesome, Adventurous and Amazing people.

  A few simple rules for this class are:
  1. You have to have fun. Period! 
  2. Everyone has to make something. Anything. Make and express yourself. 
  3. There's no bad idea, no wrong answer, no un-achievable idea.
  4. Work together, encourage each other and build upon each other's ideas. You'll be amazed at the awesome ideas and projects you'll be able to come up with if you pull in everyone's strengths. Collaboration is at the core of all good ideas!
  5. Don't be afraid to ask or to try something new. In fact, make sure you go out of your comfort zone each day. Try, fail, start again, and try some more. 
  6. Let every day be an opportunity learn something new. That's where the adventure lies!
  7. Seize the opportunity to learn, to grow and dream!

In ten years I hope to be doing more or less what I do now, only at a capacity augmented in skill, focus, and insight.  </td><td>...and we called it Music</td><td>What makes good music? Are some musics better or more important than others?  What is the function of music?  What does it take to understand music?  What is the meaning of music?  How can we talk about music? What is music in the first place?  

  This class is designed to question the assumptions we make about music and to inspire new modes of listening.  This class will not be focused on teaching you facts about music; rather, it takes as a premise that you’re already highly educated about music.  This is not to say that you’re a piano virtuoso, or have ever even taken a music class.  Instead, this class will utilize the education you’ve received as a life long listener of music in a world full of information and opinions about music.  

  In class, we will break down the process of listening and evaluating music into three distinct phases.  This system of listening operates on an analogy I call the Metaphysical Mixing Board.  Inspired from the way studio engineers use mixing boards to process raw sounds into final mixes that become records, the Metaphysical Mixing Board will help us process the raw sounds of music into sophisticated, unique, and multifaceted interpretations of the music.   

  Utilizing this process throughout during a varied set of musical activities (including performance, discussion, listening, movement, mixed-media work and more), we will discover how different cultural values intermingle to create music out of sounds.  We are going to explore hearing music as children hear music: from a vantage point of wonder.  At the end of it all, we will have gained new perspectives on the possibilities of music, new confidence in our abilities to understand music, and better understandings of our musical cultures and our musical selves.  

  This class is about drawing connections where none seem possible.  This class is about sharing inspiration through different listening experiences.  For some, this class might be about a lot more than music.  

  So, can Katy Perry and Rossini be seen to share profound commonalities from a vantage point of economics?  Can one find common ground between Dubstep synthesizers and Renaissance approaches to playing the violin?  Can Brooklyn House music and Indonesian Gamelan music share spiritualties?

  Yes.

  This class is eligible to all lovers of music, regardless of musical background or education.  You will be challenged to think creatively about music, to question every assumption you have about music.  You will be presented with music that’s familiar but also with music that’s strange, bewildering, or might not even seem like music.  You will have the opportunity to share the music you love with fellow music lovers.  You just might never listen to music the same way again.  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Evan Walker-Wells<br/>Yale<br/>Junior<br/>ewalkerwells@gmail.com</td><td>Hearing about it during the course of last year from friends who were involved--Bay and Kat especially. I've always been interested in education and Japan separately, and would love to chance to combine the two. </td><td>One of two things: Either working as a professional writer or working as a community organizer in local politics or in government in America. 

  Hopefully I'll have written a book.

  In the meantime, I'll have spent at least a year travelling and working across America, doing jobs like a waiter or a park ranger that most Yalies don't do.  Maybe I'll have gone to law school or gotten a master's in writing or history. Hopefully I'll have seen much more of the world than I have now and speak Spanish.</td><td>Poetry and the soul</td><td>With a day of high school class, I'd like to talk about how poetry challenges how we understand the soul, the world, and the relationship between them. The class would focus on talking about what makes a poem beautiful and compelling and how each poem is its own philosophy of how we know, what the world is, and who we are. The goal of the class would be for students to feel more comfortable talking about and reading and writing poetry. A day is short, so we’d probably focus on four or five poems. Off the top of my head, I’d teach with Matsuo Basho, Walt Whitman, Langston Hughes, and Louise Gluck. Each uses simple language in some of the most powerful poetry ever.

  First we’d talk about how the students think about poetry—what do they think makes a poem beautiful or successful. Maybe they haven’t thought about it, which is all the more reason to have the conversation. We’d also have to talk about what makes poetry different from other kinds of writing and art.

  Next I think it would make sense to start looking at a poem. I think several of Basho’s haiku from Narrow Road to the Interior would make a good start. Especially teaching a group of Japanese students, there’s the hope that familiar Japanese poetry might be a comfortable place to start. That’s not the only reason: Basho captures the world and how it moves the soul better than almost any poet, and his mixture of poetry and prose would also return us to how poetry is special.

  Next we’d spend a couple minutes talking about how to mark up a poem—finding important words, drawing connections between important lines and thoughts through a slightly longer poem. Marking up is a tool for reading well.

  Walt Whitman makes a great comparison to Basho. We’d look at the beginning of “Song of Myself” and talk about how poetry, the world, and the self are tangled up in Whitman’s poetry. We’d also spend some time talking about whether the students like his poetry and how it’s beautiful in different or similar ways to Basho.

  Hughes would give us the chance to talk a bit about how poetry can draw on music, cultural traditions, and history, to interact with the world—how poetry itself can help shape how we understand our souls and our duty and place in the world. Gluck’s poetry will bring us back to Basho in style, while showing us how the soul and its journey shape the poet’s imagination and perception of the world. It’ll also bring us up to the present.

  To end the discussion, I think we’d want to talk about the four poets together one last time. We’d also want to talk about how poetry might shape how we see and interact with the world—what we expect to find in life. Lastly, we’d take an hour to write our own poems and share them.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Georgiana Wagemann<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>georgiana.wagemann@yale.edu</td><td>I found out about GAKKO through a friend.  Upon further exploration of the website, I became very interested in GAKKO's mission to transform the educational system in a way that is most conducive to learning. It is safe to say that although all of us here at Yale truly love to learn and push our knowledge past its limits, we find it difficult not to get caught up with grades, tests and competition. It is important for everyone to recognize that just because someone can ace a test does not ensure that they can ace an interview or work well with a team. I wholeheartedly stand behind GAKKO's aims to help each student discover who they are and what they can bring to the table in a professional context. </td><td>In 10 years, I hope to be an investigatory broadcast journalist reporting on a wide range of international issues.  Journalism is my passion because it is not exclusively limited to a specific field.  I would like nothing more than to realize a career discovering fascinating stories and communicating them to the public. I think it is extremely important to maintain a perspective on what is going on around the world and I would love to keep the public informed with this information.</td><td>The Psychology and Economics of Music</td><td>This class would study the effects of music on the human brain and reveal why different genres of music generate different emotional responses. The course would later cover economic and marketing strategies to discuss what type of music is most effective on influencing consumer habits. We would study different types of retail stores and analyze the best music choices to maximize consumer spending.  This is dependent on what type of consumer the store is attempting to appeal to. A final project would be a collaborative design project, where groups would design a store, choose a playlist, and explain the psychological pathways that make this music the best economical choice.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Hannah Bou-Lai Lam<br/>Harvard College<br/>Sophomore<br/>hlam01@college.harvard.edu</td><td>Back home in Guam, some friends of mine sacrificed extracurriculars to go to tutoring agencies that would magically churn them back out as excellent test-takers. This "Asian" mentality is highly concentrated in places like China, Japan, and Korea. More often than not, high school students in Asia have come to believe that "education" is about rote memorization, acing standardized tests, and focusing exclusively on academics. People still believe that this regurgitated education is their ticket to a bright future.

  I often asked myself, what is my ultimate goal for learning all this "stuff"? Institutionalized schools are limited by structure and propelled by the wrong reasons. Education reform on an international scale needs to take place. Gakko's mission addresses this issue by providing learning opportunities students would never encounter in school. I believe that this program is full of brilliant and innovative ideas, and I would love to be a part of it.</td><td>I see myself as an elementary school teacher. Elementary school children have a very particular set of needs. They are just beginning to learn how to communicate clearly with the rest of society, yet they are also probably pretty familiar with the ubiquity of the world wide web. Because children are so impressionable at this age, I feel like I could make the most impact on their development into healthy relationships with themselves and the rest of the world at that point of their lives.</td><td>YOUtube: Social Media and How You Relate</td><td>Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Reddit: most of us have at least one of the above.  In an unprecedented manner, society is sharing incredible amounts of information virtually and instantaneously. Our generation especially is ushered into this world of high publicity yet low human interactions.

  The Internet, and other forms of quick information transmission in the future, will be a significant part of our lives whether we like it or not. There have been numerous concerns over whether or not the advent of the Internet is "good" or "bad", but not much discussion on how we can deal with this virtual reality. Rather youth should frame dialogue around a different set of questions. For instance, how do we participate in this new realm of social interaction in a healthy way? What sorts of boundaries should we set? What implications does the modern information-saturated society have for education? There are so many ways to talk about the Internet that is not simply dichotic.

  In participating in this relevant discourse, students will be pressed to reflect on what it means to be a part of a larger society that extends throughout the entire globe. Through a class like this, participants can hopefully get closer to understanding the source and sanctity of individual identity.</td></tr>

While there, I worked with the education department on improving the museum’s high school programming and making contemporary art more accessible to the general public.

By empowering students to address the issues that matter to them, The Future Project hopes to redefine our country’s public schooling system as a place that cultivates creativity and innovation instead of stifling them. 
  While traveling, this past summer I was confronted by the global need for education reform.  While in Seoul, Korea on a Light Fellowship, I became friends with korean university students and was disturbed by how much their educational experience differed from my own.  They had no concept that learning should be anything but a means to an ends.  When I explained the liberal arts model to them, they were amazed that such a style of learning even existed.  I take for granted being able to study what I love.  While in Cameroon with Yale Engineers Without Borders, I witnessed an even more backwards educational system.  There, students were so entrenched in a system of rote memorization that they lacked the creativity to write letters to pen pals in New Haven.  It was only when the teacher wrote a letter on the board that they were able to copy it, producing a classroom full of identical letters.  An education that fosters creativity and innovation should be a right, not a privilege.  GAKKO is full of amazingly creative and forward-thinking people and I would love to join in their mission.</td><td>I see myself working at the intersection of science and design.  Perhaps I will be using research in cognitive science to design more intuitive information graphics or applying an eye for design to engineering problems.  </td><td>STEAM Power</td><td>Where does innovation come from?  How can education dictate progress?  In the United States and many other countries, the answer to these questions has been in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  These fields, known collectively as STEM, are seen as the key to innovation, progress.  They will stimulate our crumbing economies, confront the world’s many problems, and usher us into a shining future.  In many ways, this is all very true.  Advances in these fields will make undoubtably us healthier and more prosperous.  The promotion of these fields should not, however, come at the expense of other fields.  STEM does not have a monopoly on innovation.  All to often missing in the innovation discussion is the role of art and design.  In this class, I will address the place of art and design in STEM and innovation.
  Art and design are often the first to be cast aside as frivolous pursuits in a progress driven society.  In this class, we will explore how art and design are essential to innovation, starting with an exercise invented by the Rhode Island School of Design.  Students will be challenged to use provided materials to design and build a tool that can be used to pick up an egg, move it, break it over a bowl and then beat it.  The purpose of the exercise is to explore the process by which we approach problems and create novel solutions.  To create an elegant solution for the problem posed by this exercise it takes much more than the mechanical ability to engineer the finished product.  More important is the spacial problem solving ability needed to visualize a functional product from the available resources.  The engineering ability is merely an enabler for the initial creative spark.  Creativity is what links art and science, and is absolutely necessary for innovation.  The students will be guided towards these ideas through a discussion of the difficulties they encountered in designing and building their products.  The goal is to demonstrate that creative processes are essential in producing innovative solutions for engineering problems.  
  The class will then be introduced to a few case studies of the intersection between art and science.  Art and science weren’t always seen as such separate realms.  Take for example, Leonardo da Vinci who held similar acclaim for his success both in the arts and in the sciences.  Other such examples include Samuel Morse and Rufus Porter.  As a class we will discuss examples of artists and designers that rely on science and engineering, such as John Maeda and Paul Ramirez Jonas.  We will also discuss examples of technology and engineering companies relying on art and design, such as Ximedica, Apple, and Google.  The goal is to foster the concept that art, design, and STEM work best when each is used to inform the other.  Ultimately, I hope that the students will see the power of STEAM (STEM + Art and Design) and its essential role in innovation.

  <tr><td>Debayan Gupta<br/>Yale<br/>Graduate School Student<br/>debayan.gupta@yale.edu</td><td>I first heard of this gig from Kenta Koga
  who was a student of mine for a bit.
  He reminisced about GAKKO again this Octoba
  and convinced me this time to apply for it.

  My interest in GAKKO stems chiefly 
  from things that (if you count them) number two:
  Teaching for many years - by no means briefly,
  And teachers that instead of trying to teach, actually do!

  What are these ideas and ideals we learn
  From inside school, but more commonly out
  That change our lives at every turn
  - I'd say these are important things to think about!</td><td>Politics.

  There are plenty of projects I plan to pursue (as I have, in the present and past), but I'm a person of permutable persuasion on a perplexing planet. Per-contra, I do have some propositions at which I purport to persevere passionately, pococurante towards any problems in my path. Preeminent among these: I want to promote the progress of my country, so that the People may prosper.

  Thus, Politics.</td><td>History of Leadership</td><td>What do Alexander the Great, Steve Jobs, and Bob Dylan have in common? We take a look at the lives and likes of men and women who have changed the world around them not by chance, but by design, hard work, and in some cases, hallucinogenic substances.

  What is a leader? From academics to monarchs, from bankers to musicians, from entrepreneurs to military commanders - there are leaders in every field. What is it that sets these people apart from everyone else? As we study their character and credo, we shall dig deep into the qualities that they embody.

  <tr><td>Iwona Chalus<br/>Yale College, JE (LUX)<br/>Freshman <br/>iwona.chalus@yale.edu</td><td>I first learnt about GAKKO 2013 thanks to Lavinia's article in YDN and the FB event. The approach to education proposed and practiced by GAKKO in many point overlaps with my personal opinions about how the education and learning process should be motivated. I believe that through participation in GAKKO I will be able to not only contribute to the camp (because of my academic interest in science/education policy) but also benefit from the interaction with other senpais and with kohais.
  Currently, in order to develop my interest in STEM education policies, I am volunteering for a Curriculum Development Project on CRISP Outreach Program. 
  </td><td>As the majority of Yalies, I have approximately billions of billions (within an order of magnitude) ideas for my post-college life and professional career, and I try not to limit my options too early. 
  But what I would particularly enjoy to do is to work as a researcher in the academia environment, where the freedom of choice of your research topic is much greater than in industry. Therefore, 10 years from now, I will most probably be serving as a post-doc or an assistant professor. 

  Since teaching is one of the most enjoyable parts of the professional academia experience (as it brings relatively rapid results), GAKKO fits into my long-term planning because it will hopefully help me to develop sustainable approaches to teaching-learning processes.</td><td>Modern liberal arts - debating education approaches'</td><td>The class would discuss how learning of literature and science contributes to the understanding of individuals and societies. We would attempt to answer the questions such as: how our background and education influence our perception? Are we able to limit our cultural paradigm? To what extent learning of literature, biology and geography enlightens us about human beings and their interactions? Should prospective layers take mandatory literature class in order to improve their ability to pass morally-sound judgments? Is the old good liberal arts model so good? What are the alternatives for it and what alternatives does not yer exist but should be developed? Can we come up with the idea of modern liberal arts education?

  It would be a discussion-based seminar, in which the topics covered each week would be to a great extent adjusted to the specific interests of the participants and the currents events in the world. The discussions and teamwork projects would account for ~60% of the class time.

  Laptop and smartphone use in classroom would be allowed if and only if one is looking for information/data that are going to immediately be use in the seminar discussion.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Dennis August Sun<br/>Harvard University<br/>Sophomore<br/>dennissun@college.harvard.edu</td><td>I'm interested in working in Japan this summer as an intern, and I think that this type of opportunity would be great for diversifying my summer experience in Japan. I visited Japan last summer as part of a gasshuku for my school's kendo team, and loved the experience. Japanese people seem incredibly kind and easy to get along with, and I wanted to explore the idea of living and working in Japan in the future. With a summer of different experiences in Japan, I'm hoping to explore that possibility by getting to know Japanese culture and Japanese people. I feel that this sort of unique teaching and mentoring experience could allow me to truly connect with Japan. Furthermore, I would like to try my hand at teaching; it's something I've entertained as a possible career path in the future, but have never had the time nor opportunity to explore. I've always held the notion that, in a truly intelligent world, teachers would be those highest paid - the work they do for the world is selfless and utterly imperative. Without them, the scientific, technological, and literary accomplishments of humanity would quickly go forgotten, and the functions of our global society could come to a halt. I'm interested in helping the world in my small way by someday becoming a teacher of some kind, whether as a professor in a university or an instructor in a secondary education setting, and I think that this sort of experience in working with new, innovative ways of delivering information would be a key component of that experience.</td><td>I'm presently entertaining ideas of going into graduate school for biology and entering the tenure track for universities, but this is still a bit up-in-the-air. Beyond my interest in the sciences, I'm also very interested in creative writing and graphic design - these are all different paths that could branch out from my present course. So, in an ideal world, in ten years I might be working in a lab, designing beautiful pamphlets and lecture slides and other materials, writing short stories and novels in my free time, and exercising regularly. Beyond that, in this dream of mine, I would love to someday become a professor who researches and teaches and gets students excited about some aspect of science, humanities, or an intersection of the two. I believe that academia doesn't have to be exclusive and pretentious, and that the dissemination of information is the most important part of the world we live in. As the terribly hackneyed elementary school adage goes: knowledge is power. The world is fueled by knowledge and needs knowledge to function - on a metaphorical level, it is as powerful if not more powerful than electricity itself. If I may elevate myself for but a moment, I would hope that my current and future educational experiences would put me in a position where the responsibility would lie on me to take the knowledge I have gained over the course of my life and return it to and distribute it around the world. </td><td>Vizualization: The Art of Informational Representation</td><td>As the world becomes more and more technologically advanced and aesthetically driven, visual media are becoming critical to the presentation of information in all fields. From advertisements to lecture slides to conference posters, visual graphics can help accurately and clearly convey concepts that otherwise might not be easily described using words alone. In this one-day course, we will examine innovative ways of presenting information in a variety of fields, ranging from the scientific to the journalistic to the entrepreneurial. Taking the information we learn from the work done by the rest of the world, we will develop a single, polished portfolio for representing information about each student's life. This project will serve as an example of how we can use such graphic design skills to improve not only business and educational functions, but also how we as individuals can learn about ourselves by representing our experiences in the visual mode. Included in this portfolio would be things such as an individual brand identity, a life summary created in the format of a company pamphlet, and a reflective document discussing the experience of creating the project itself, with images of failed ideas, future directions, and a general dissection of each student's creative process.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Naoki Fujiwara<br/>Waseda university<br/>Sophomore<br/>naoki.math@gmail.com</td><td>The reason why I'm interested in GAKKO is that I feel sympathy for GAKKO's mission. I believe education become more and more exciting and creative. However, when i was a high school student, there is no opportunities for learning like that. GAKKO try to have impact on Japan's education. I also want to contribute to this wonderful action.  </td><td>I have not decided what i want to do in 10 years, but my goal is to make Japan's education better. In addition, I really like learning math or subject related to math. So now I think to learn for more years after I graduate universsity. Without learning enough, I cannot find the best education in the future. Therefore I will learn mathematical subject in somewhere. </td><td>The history of math -how we have been attracted by its beauty -</td><td>Mathematics has extremely long history. The history of how math has developed is also the history of human advancement. Math has not been found on the street. Math is invented by our great ancestors. Newton described this as “Standing on the shoulders of giants”. So behind history of math, dramas of many mathematicians exist. 

  I’ll talk mainly two topics. One is Fermat’s last theorem, the other is Poincare’s theorem. These topics are already known for many people who have interest in math. However, unfortunately, most students, even creative students, have no interests in math. To enjoy these two topics, it is not necessary for students to calculate difficult problems. Both are very simple in terms of expression, but their histories contain a lot of dramas.  
  For example, Fermat’s last theorem has not been solved for 300 years, and many brilliant mathematicians, including Euler or Gauss, tackled with it and defeated. Some people lost their lives because they cannot solve it. However, in order to solve this problem, many new mathematics were invented. They cannot solve it but they really improved math and it is now widely applied. This theorem really contributed our life. 

  Math is always talked in terms of whether it is useful for us, not in terms of its beauty.
  I would like to show dramas for showing math is beauty and human-like.

  <tr><td>Mai Miyata<br/>Waseda<br/>Freshman <br/>mai.miyata1221@gmail.com</td><td>I have always questioned the education system in Japan. Especially during my juken (entrance exam) preparation, I could not help thinking how I am missing out on so much of my life. However, even when such thoughts crossed my mind, I did not have the courage to leave my studies and go experience valuable things. This was because Japanese society still puts much value in juken, and it is not simple to get out of it. I am not criticizing the actual content of the Japanese education, but of the way they are taught. How can students be motivated to simply memorize historical facts, english grammar and so on? Furthermore, how are these things we learn, and the way we learn them practical in real life? These are the queries I have been questioning constantly. There must be ways to bring life to school studies. I strongly feel that GAKKO will help me find a way to do this. The skills I gain here will not only help high school students, but also my self. Perhaps the way I study at university will drastically change too. </td><td>I see various possibilities for my future. I have not narrowed down just yet. However, there is one theme that is lying underneath them all which concerns the movement of people, in other words, immigration, and the interaction between people, culture etc. that is created as a consequence. 
  One image I see is of myself continuing with the study and research of immigrants and trying to find a solution in ways for different types of people with various beliefs, cultures, and so on, to co-exist without any form of conflict. From these researches, I will either present them in essays or presentations or I will actually take action and work to lessen tensions between people in places where there are frictions. Or I could go to schools and teach students at an early stage of how to accept others who are different. 
  Another image I have is of myself working as a journalist. The great thing about journalism is how you can cover so many news of this world without having to dedicate yourself to just one field. There are many forms of problems relating to immigration in each country. By becoming a journalist, I will be able to dig deeper into each country's immigration system and perhaps be able to come up with possible tactics to deal with immigration and the conflict that arises between different cultures. 
  </td><td>A different look on history</td><td>This class will aim to inspire ordinary high school students who go to school just for the sake of it to see how much they could make out of their school lives. This was the case for myself as well, but I used to go to high school to simply attend class for no real purpose but for the aid of juken (entrance exam) preparation and then go home. Here, nothing that I learned from high school would actually come useful other than for juken and to aid in my future university studies. 
  This is especially the case with the subject of history. How can you study history without just memorizing for juken? History is and should be a far more interesting field of study. Here, we will not try and learn history in chronological order as like most Japanese history classes. We will focus on one topic, for example the history of Olympics. First we will focus on the ancient Olympics, and analyze Ancient Greece. This will be a great opportunity to study about the history of the Greek empire. We can learn not only about the Olympics but their mythologies and cultures. Although we will not have time for this, however, when the students have the chance to come across reading the Odyssey or the Illiad, they might recall this history lesson and what we learned from it. This class teaches you history while it also deepens your general education/knowledge. 
  After focusing on the Ancient Olympics and Ancient Greece, we can then move on to a recent Olympics, for example the Beijing Olympics. Here we will learn about the modern Olympics in general and the problems that did not exist back in the Ancient Olympics, for example things like terrorist attacks in the munich Olympics. After going over these significant modern historical events that will be taught in usual Japanese history classes, we can then focus on the Beijing Olympics itself and analyze the situation of modern China. But before we go on to that, since we studied about Ancient Greece as an example to an ancient civilization, we can focus on Ancient China as well. After that, we will cover modern china from around the period before Mao Zedong’s rule and see the violent changes in China from then on. This piece of history investigated is not just learning about history. It will also help students into seeing the importance of today’s china’s situation and the political and economical problems faced by the global world we live in. 
  Hopefully this class will change normal student who just go to school just for the sake of it to see that if the way things are taught at school is altered like in my class, things can have an absolutely new perspective.

  The purpose will be to improve my students knowledge in history, economy, logic, calculus, architecture, geography, French…by making them think, travel, dream, overcome their fears and their prejudices.

  The class will take place for 2/3, outside on the beach, for 1/3, Inside in a classroom or small auditorium.

  Our « Tools » will be the usual equipments to build sand castles on a beach, thirteen-knot-ropes, camcorders, notepads, pencils, computers or pads connected to the web, projector, screen and an old huge globe .

  Following a plan each team will built a sand castle ( sort of a french medieval castle – château-fort) using shovel and bucket and also a thirteen-knot-rope to understand some concepts of geometry and architecture.
  By some tricks, I’ll try to show my students that very often they are following rules that don’t exist and losing time, and energy…

  Then, sitted on the beach there will be thoughts and questionnings about why médiéval castle were built, médiéval and actual fears and prejudices and how to fight them.
  Lunch break
  At this level, students will be encouraged to do some research on the web to improve,complément, correct or criticize what have been done in the morning (Inside).

  Then, direction and production of a short movie which plot will be the rescue of the princess, captive in the keep (middle-age machismo) . (outside).

  The set will be very sober but the direction will have to take account of the constraints learnt from building the castle.

  Acting will be food for thought on content and torm :
  Content : bow and arrows, the way doors open, boiling oil…
  Form : articulation, playing a part, French…

  The short-movies will be shown and commentated.
  I will keep in mind thèse two quotations :
  « When one teaches, two learn… »
  « Tell me and I’ll forget, Teach me and I’ll remember,Involve me and I’ll learn. »

  <tr><td>Maggie Yellen<br/>Yale University<br/>Junior<br/>margaret.yellen@yale.edu</td><td>
  	I am interested in Gakko because learning, I think, is not just about preparing for a career or even about preparing for life—learning is a part of life itself. During high school, I looked forward to all of my classes. I loved pounding my fist to make a point or getting way too excited about some line in a poem. Every day, my classmates, my teacher, and I banded together to understand the world. In the process, we learned about each other; in the process, we learned about ourselves. 
  	At Yale, then, I was disappointed to hear about my friends’ high schools—and, honestly, I was even disappointed with my Yale classes. It seemed like we were so busy learning information that we didn’t have time for knowledge. I think there is a difference, too—information is just groups of facts, even skills. Knowledge is when that information becomes a part of life. 
  	That is why I was so excited to hear about Gakko. I would absolutely love to have the opportunity to contribute to this amazing project—to think about how to teach (and think!) in the short term and how to improve general education in the long term. I am also fascinated by the cross-cultural component. Particularly as someone who loves language, I would be really interested to talk about the differences between expression in Japanese and English (and what that means for how we view the world). Also, I have visited Japan once before, and it’s such a beautiful, fascinating country—I would love to go back and learn more. 
  	In the end, I guess I’m just ready to shake it up. Too many people, I think, live their lives walking through narrow hallways, afraid to peer into a side door or walk to a different floor. I want to change that. And yes, I want to teach—but teaching, at its core, is about learning. As a captain of my high school mock trial team, I loved being a mentor, teacher, and friend to my younger teammates—they always challenged my ideas and made me think harder. For a few weeks, at least, I want to remember that feeling of teaming up to take on the universe—and falling in love with it instead.  
  </td><td>In ten years, I hope to be writing--I would love to be at the New Yorker, but I would go to any magazine, really. I want to write about people and their stories--to teach the public how much they can learn from each other. Really, though, I'm not set on a career--who knows? I could end up being an international lawyer or a nomad who travels and writes and lives on nothing. No matter what career I end up in, though, I always want to be immersed in my community. I want to always be able to start an hour-long conversation with a stranger, I want to be able to walk into a library and spend time learning something new. </td><td>Writing the World (or Found in Translation)</td><td>Write the world. A pen is like a wand—it can wrangle an emotion and force it into ink. To me, words are a special kind of music; they capture the intangible in rhythm and melody. Poetry, in particular, holds special power. Each word must be picked carefully—every line can be analyzed, read five different ways. The meter, too, adds structure to the sound. 
  	My favorite classes in high school were always poetry classes. I loved taking some dull-looking text and finding life in it. Every time I analyzed a poem, I had to revise my understanding of the world and of myself. The classes did not simply teach me about poetry, or about English—they made me realize the power of language to shape the world. They made me realize the power of my own words, too. 
  	If I could teach a high school class for a day, then, I would teach a class about writing the world—the power of words. The class would start with a poem (probably an the Love song of J. Alfred Prufrock). I would ask the class to read through the poem. Then, I would direct them to a few lines poem and ask them how the words felt (NOT, at first, what they meant)—this initial exercise would lead to a close analysis of each line of the poem. We would focus, in particular, on the possible meanings of each word, as well as the overall sound of the poem. 
  	Next, I would ask students to split into groups. First, each group would act out an interpretation of the poem—this way, they could transform words into motion and even sound. Moving away from the poem, then, I would ask each group to describe an emotion in a limited number of words--to use their own creativity and voices to capture an abstract idea. Finally, we would return to the poem and see what new perspectives we could apply. (this could even happen much later in the day—after other classes). As an assignment, everyone in the class would have to memorize a poem and recite it in a social setting (or a line from a poem--and fit it into an everyday conversation!).
  	This class, I think, would fit the Gakko project well. At first, when I was thinking of a class, I tried to think of really big ideas—how to make my students see the beauty in each other and the world around them. I soon realized, though, that the little ideas are sometimes more useful. I think that it would be cool to show the kids at Gakko that deep learning can happen even with “typical” pieces of text. Even a boring literature class, with the right mindset and guidance, can change into a life-changing experience. In a bi-lingual context, too, the class could become a “found in translation”—we could discuss words that don’t exist in the other language, and we could even try to translate poems while maintaining their meaning.

I used sign language, and developed new ways to communicate ideas about rhythm, flow and synchronization without the use of words or sounds. At Yale, as founder of ‘The Myanmar Project,’ I lead a group of Yalies who run workshops for high school and college students from Burmese refugee families. We design creative workshops and hands-on activities to empower and motivate these students to learn. Through my years of teaching students who are both challenging and inspiring, I realized that teaching is not just about telling or demonstrating, but also about helping students realize things or arrive at ideas on their own.

  <tr><td>Andrew Goble<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>andrew.goble@yale.edu</td><td>I was originally interested in GAKKO when I first heard about it from Kenta and Flo my freshman year. I wasn’t totally sure what was going to happen--I knew very little about education in Japan and wasn’t sure what reforming it would actually mean. However, when they returned, I was very interested in both the problems they attacked and how they solved them. Kenta’s Powerpoint showed a lot of the “results” I had been interested in seeing: there were problems to be solved, and there were solutions that made kids excited about learning again.
      I come from a public high school in a suburb of Kansas City, MO, and I experienced almost every “type” of education. There were strict, grade-driven classes, and even strict creative classes (Jazz/Marching Band). But the ones that stuck with me the most were very similar to the experience I thought GAKKO was trying to create in Japan: demanding of hard work, but allowing for exciting and even fun discussions between the teacher and student. I delved into subjects only when the teachers made me want to do so, not when they talked for 90 minutes straight. I unfortunately knew many students who lost all interest in education because they didn’t take the few intense-but-rewarding classes. I thought it was sad that students willing to work hard in Japan weren’t given those opportunities, and I’d like to help change that.</td><td>I could see myself going down a lot of paths in 10 years. Journalism is probably the field I’m most interested in, and this stems from my interest in creating stories and relating to people. I could also see myself being interested in business, if that job gave me chances to share ideas and create things that people want.
      I have always liked storytelling--whether it’s verbal, in an article, or in a photography assignment--because they give me a chance to share the story of someone else and make it relatable. It’s exciting to create something that elicits emotions from the reader. They don’t always have to be serious. That sounds kind of vague, but here are some links to my favorite things I’ve done that convey what I like to do most:

  http://smeharbinger.net/news/cyberbullying-is-school-problem

  http://smeharbinger.net/features/gobles-story-goes-here

  www.gq.com/style/profiles/201206/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic-photos-street-style

  One day, I hope that, whatever I end up doing, I get to do it on several different mediums, because they all challenge me. Twitter challenges me to be concise, while photography challenges me to leave the right impression, while personal essays challenge me to make an important point. All of them are different, and I like that day-to-day challenge.</td><td>The Power of the Story</td><td>This class talks about the power of the story--the power of “showing rather than telling.” My inspiration from this class comes from two different sources. In high school, I went to Gloria Shields journalism Camp and took a class called “Specialized Writing.” In it, we exhaustively discussed “Sarah’s Hope,” a great article that told the heartbreaking story of a girl who was miserable because of how everyone treated her for being obese. 

  The story was told in multiple parts (http://kcsweb.kcstar.com/projects/sarah/) and almost exclusively told the story through her perception and emotions. It really taught me that telling someone’s story was more effective than just saying “making fun of people because they are obese is mean”--the details and anecdotes were so effective in creating a more lasting impression than that. As a growing teenager, stories like this also helped shape my morals and drive to help others; before that, I could just brush off problems that weren't at my front doorstep.
      In my class, we would be writing about ourselves, using a narrative style to talk about something that usually people are too nervous to share. I would first read a story (maybe “Sarah’s Hope,” but I have others as well), stopping frequently to both reveal techniques and ask students about what details or parts they liked the most. I would also plan on sharing something personal about myself through an essay. This would help students feel comfortable, and it would also help to break down the student/teacher power dynamic.

  The major tips that I want to share are:

  -“Giving up” a part of yourself in a story can feel great. You get a chance to share your side, to make people understand what you’ve gone through. Even if you don’t publish it, it can be emotionally satisfying to organize your thoughts on paper.

  -You don’t have to use big words or complex syntax to tell a great story.

  -Telling a story “in the moment” is a powerful narrative technique.

  -Show, don’t tell.


  Depending on how much time I’m allowed, a short class might not allow for a personal essay to be written. However, we could then move to other, shorter mediums of storytelling: twitter posts, blog posts, even video blog posts (I have a video camera/mic setup). Each is important in the future of communication, and each uses skills of “show, don’t tell” writing in a fun, modern way.

  Other note: I’m not sure what the position of photographer would entail (if it meant teaching a class or if it was just a solo), but I’d be interested in that as well. I also shoot video/have experience with professional social media work, if any of those are of interest!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Charley Locke<br/>Yale University<br/>Junior<br/>charlotte.locke@yale.edu</td><td>	I was born abroad, and have tried to take advantage of opportunities to travel as much as I can. I spent last spring semester studying abroad in Morocco; while there, I lived with a host family in the Rabat medina, and got very close to my host sisters. When I spoke with them about how they regarded their educations and their hopes for the future, I was struck by the very different roles they saw for themselves as Moroccan women, and by how much the scope of their outlooks had been shaped by prevalent social values. It was so frustrating to see that these young women, who were attending the best high schools and universities in Morocco, had never been encouraged to see their educations as a chance to envision and explore different futures for themselves. I've spoken to several of my close friends who were a part of last year’s GAKKO trip, and it sounds like an extraordinary opportunity.  Not only would I get a close view of a very different culture, but I'd also be able to interact with bright, eager, and intellectually curious young Japanese students.  Helping to enable them to get the most they can out of a more individualized style of education will give me new understandings of their culture and outlook as well as my own.</td><td>	I don’t have a clear path for what I want to be doing after graduation (and certainly not for 10 years from now). What I am certain of is that I fervently love reading and the interaction with other cultures afforded by travel. When done right, I see both of those values as expression of the same value of thoughtful empathy; you can better contribute to the world around you by trying to thoroughly understand the mindsets of others, whether by immersing yourself in their written perspective or through conversation and thoughtful observation. I know that I want to center my life, and, if possible, my work, around this idea, ideally by understanding different cultures through living within them. So much fear and violence in the world have come from the inability or unwillingness to make that empathetic leap into understanding each other, and particularly as the forces of globalization make the world smaller, the consequences of our misunderstanding of each other have become greater. I want to try to help people find the commonality among the differences, and to reduce the fear and aggression that stems from our misunderstandings. I’m not sure how I want to do this, but I can see myself working to broaden the perspectives of young people, perhaps by trying to pass on my love of reading (and inherent exposure to other mindsets) to them.</td><td>Self-Expression and Self-Understanding Through Writing</td><td>Starting out the college application process, I remember feeling stymied by the prompts asking me to neatly encapsulate who I am and what I’m about in a 750 word personal statement. But afterwards, I really appreciated the opportunity to figure out who I was in an effort to communicate it to someone else. I wished that I’d had an opportunity to do so earlier; there hadn’t been any opportunities for nonacademic nonfiction writing at my high school. I’d like to help GAKKO students figure out how to articulate their own identities in that way, through reading a few acclaimed short essays (particularly a few that deal very articulately with the idea of useful self-expression – “On Keeping a Notebook” by Joan Didion and “Why Bother?” by Jonathan Lethem come immediately to mind), talking through ideas with each other and as a group, and finally by writing and reading aloud brief personal essays. 
  	As I imagine it, this class would expose students to the consciousnesses of others and give them a chance to articulate their own gracefully. An ability to express themselves thoughtfully and concisely will be both practically useful, as they increasingly will be required to do so in applications and to others, and personally valuable, at a time when they’re starting to figure out and define themselves as individuals.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Christine Hong<br/>Yale, TC<br/>Sophomore<br/>christine.hong@yale.edu</td><td>I am mainly attracted to Gakko’s mission to re-examine education. While growing up in a very structured school setting, I definitely felt there must be another, better approach to learning. I felt very frustrated with many of my classes which I felt were not teaching me skills I would ever apply in real life. If I connected with a teacher or subject, I was very surprised and grateful. This is not how education should be. All classes should feel inspiring, or at least useful, and targeted to the individual.</td><td>In ten years, I see myself helping launch a CSR technology startup company. I want to contribute to the development of an innovative valuable product, preferably one that helps the world work more efficiently and reduce waste. To get people to actually use the product though, marketing is so important, or else people would not even discover the product’s benefits.</td><td>Pitching Your Idea: the Art of Appeal </td><td>You may have a great idea for an organization or business, but the only way to make it a success is to show others (consumers, influencers, other talented passionate workers) what a great idea it is. The only way to do this is through effective marketing, or the art of appeal. This class will show how to popularize your idea to others, whether it is a small project or a large organization.

  We have limited time for this class so we will focus on how to pitch your ideas in general and also look at how to handle marketing for the two main types of projects for beginners: a nonprofit organization and a small business.

  The structure of the class with be

  1.	Workshop on how to pitch and idea that focuses on:
  a.	Evaluating the value of your ideas – value proposition framework to target     your audience
  b.	Creating and refining ideas –distinguish between an interesting idea (a novel approach to doing something) and a truly GOOD idea (not just creative, but has logic; it improves on a meaningful quality in a way that can be practically applied to the project). 
  c.	Assess the scope of your idea – research how others pitching ideas of similar scope went about it
  d.	Structuring a pitch - Figure out who has the power to green light your idea and imagine the perspectives of these people. Develop and refine 3 levels of depth to pitch your idea (5 seconds, 30 seconds, 5 minutes).
  e.	Practice delivery of and test a pitch


  2.	Workshop on marketing that focuses on:
  a.	Networking – Learn from others in your industry who have a lot more experience than you 

  b.	The direct approach over general approach
  i.	Why targeting a direct audience is better use of resources
  ii.	Good direct marketing tools and how to pick the best combination 
  1.	Defining your ideal customer description
  2.	Finding out how to reach those prospects
  3.	Finding how your customers buy
  iii.	Direct approach reversed - Make people find you by creating content that they find valuable (blog posts, newsletters) that start the conversation and reveal your knowledge in your field.

  c.	Main types of promotional strategies and finding the one that works for your project/company (building your brand)

  d.	Special segment on how companies can use causes to their advantage  and nonprofits can utilize the media - Giving customers a sense of being a part of something larger simply by using products they might use anyway creates a win/win situation.


  This lesson is advice for bigger projects/groups but it can definitely be applied to all types of situations in daily life. Knowing how to pitch your ideas, no matter how brilliant they are, is an essential skill for everyone.

  <tr><td>Upasna Sharma<br/>Harvard College<br/>Sophomore<br/>upasnasharma@college.harvard.edu</td><td>I have a major complaint with the classroom structure as it promotes the idea of education only being limited to the classroom. Being an advocate of learning for the sake of learning as opposed to just as a means to an end, I feel that schooling should happen in a way that kohai incorporate what they learn into their day outside of the classroom. This encourages students to approach learning in any sphere, and at any time, with a positive mindset. This is very similar to education approached in ancient India-- during the Vedic times, where the shishya (student) would ordinarily spend years of his life living with his Guru (teacher) and other classmates. They would live and learn together, so as the idea of "stopping learning" after a certain point of the day never arose!  An idea how to do so is detailed in the section below. 

  Schools here, and back home both seem to promote an environment where education is seen as a means to an end. Very professional-school oriented, therefore, a vast majority treat education as a process one must get through in order to get a job. It seems to be quite a depressing outlook toward school, not to mention quite a dull way to spend so many important years of one's life, that stifle creativity, encourage a swallow-vomit knowledge culture, that doesn't encourage thinking or forming new ideas on one's own! Additionally, one becomes so used to taking directions that I see quite a few people fumble when they are given open-ended directions. 
  I am an international student at Harvard from India. The rigidity in structure and style of teaching/learning back home frustrated me many a time throughout middle and high school, and the liberal arts system in the United States seemed like a blessed alternative. However, after coming here, I realized that education on neither side of the seas is perfect, and this venture seems to be an great opportunity to brainstorm new ideas on education. I feel that it is important to acknowledge that neither system is the "best", and to collectively work together to create an amalgamation. I view GAKKO as a great opportunity to get acquainted with people who share similar frustrations regarding the education system and the state of education in general. By interacting with like-minded people, and brainstorming ideas regarding education reform, and just by learning from them in general (by hearing their diverse thoughts and opinions), I hope that it shall help me gain more direction regarding how I wish to proceed with education reform. If possible, I would also like to see GAKKO in India at some point because I feel that my country is also one that would similarly hugely benefit from having similar dialogue.</td><td>There are a couple of options I am considering, however, my main goal is to make the maximum possible positive impact upon the immediate community. 

  I shall probably be heading back to India. I wish to either work in education reform or in working toward affordable energy. Currently, the maximum change that can be brought about is still by working directly with the Government, so the Ministry of Education is one option. The job they offer includes having to spend significant portions of time in different locations, and as I like to work at the grassroots as I feel that allows one to see the impact of one's policies hands-on.
  I am quite passionate about making affordable sources of energy available to the rural Indian populace as we are still an agricultural country, yet around 3/4 of my country still doesn't not have access to electricity. I feel this is critical, not only for agricultural growth, but because of cheap availability of electronics such as computers, also allows the rural folk to gain access to education that might not be immediately available to them otherwise.</td><td>Dance, Sounds and Meditation: Learning crossing the borders</td><td>I have been trained in Indian classical dance (Bharatanatyam) for 11 years, and it is, to say the least, quite close to my heart. It is a dance form that involves quick hand and footwork, as well as facial expressions. It is done in three styles: Nritta-- which is pure hand and footwork, exhibiting crispness and mastery of the movements, Natya, which is mainly facial expressions and limited hand/footwork, the goal being to tell a story to the audience, and Nritya, which is a combination of both. While being a very expressive dance form, in my training, I have so far only been taught to follow the guru in terms of what a certain dance piece is going to be about, what hand gestures to use, etc. Additionally, Bharatanatyam is a very structured dance, many a time, requiring one to hold a certain complicated position for some time. I wish to experiment with these aspects of the dance.
   I wish to hold a dance workshop where I would share essentials of Bharatanatyam with the kohai, and exhibit how *generally*, one uses certain facial expressions and hand gestures to convey a certain meaning. However, I feel it would be interesting to let the students have free reign from then on, and ask them to create a play or a dance where they perform a short story of their own composition. As it is a dance, they would not be allowed to speak of course, however, facial expressions and hand gestures would be their aid. They would have also access to music from the tappings of their foot (different intensities of tappings can convey different emotions), as well as access to bells traditionally tied around feet by dancers. I wish to also play around with the idea of rigid structure in the dance. I am experienced in traditional Hindu meditation and feel it would be useful to spend some time meditating and focusing on letting external factors leave the body and allowing the natural flow (sound of water, flow of the breeze) to instead take control. External worries and pressures stifle creativity and happiness. Although the final presentation would be their own composition, I would like them to include certain steps that I taught in the beginning in some way or the other at some point in the presentation. This serves a dual purpose—kohai learn certain specific pieces of knowledge, but also get to be creative with the majority of the class. They can come up to me if they have a particular emotion they wish to express and wish to know how it is done traditionally, but it would also be great if they can come up with their own style!
  As you can see, the class is not limited to only one portion of the day, nor is it limited to a certain subject. I would like the kohai to go about their day noticing sounds made by walking in different ways that they may not have noticed before, noticing how facial expressions and hand gestures come into play in conversation that they may not have considered before, and it brings dance and meditation together—it it is truly learning that transcends the classroom and filters into daily life.

If it weren’t for many people, I would not have been able to follow through with my aspirations and dreams. I try to be grateful by giving back to the society what I have learned along the way. Among my goals, I want to improve the education system in Spain, which relies on memorization skills, grades and absolutely no interaction between professors and students. GAKKO seeks to find a new concept of education, so I look forward to joining the team and spreading what I will learn as a member to other countries, such as mine. 
  </td><td>The universe, flight and cooking are my passions in life. In the future, I would love to work in the field of astronomy to gain a better understanding of the cosmos and everything that surrounds me. I also want to be a pilot. To see the world from above is an incredible experience that everyone should live at some point; it teaches me the beauty of our world. I would also like to open a small restaurant, where I would identify each dish with the name and life of an artist (just as I did in my blog cooktheunvierse.wordpress.com!). Finally, I am now trying to create an association to help evicted families, so I would like to continue working on it to fight against housing eviction, an important problem in Spain.</td><td>To live or to exist?</td><td>While existing is a simple biological process, living implies something more, such as loving the instant, discovering the Other and fighting for a better world. In this class, students and teacher would engage in conversations to explore the possible definitions of “living”, as opposed to the simple fact of “existing”. There would not be a final answer, but students would have been able to share their experiences in different ways, including food, poems, science or music.

I have been involved and led various initiatives that help do this, including: One Laptop Per Child, TED and TEDxYale, and HackYale. Gakko is at the forefront of kick-starting questions that enable us to think outside of conventional educational paradigms to ask questions like: 'what would we teach? what would I want to learn? what does the perfect education look like? how do we foster lifelong learning? etc. Furthermore, I really believe that the world should have 7 billion teachers and 7 billion students and I want to help play a role in creating the world I wish to see. </td><td>I would like to be running a social enterprise foundry. That is to say, I would like to be running a non-profit that researches, ideates, and founds social enterprises that solve important social problems in a financially sustainable way. I have been involved in learning about and with social enterprises for the past 2 years and think a more effective and efficient model can be developed. I am working on imagening that model. </td><td>The World As Your Jungle Gym</td><td>I have been known to do crazy workouts in public places, e.g., on a Beijing subway: http://blog.milesgrimshaw.com/travel.html
  I think more people should think creatively about their bodies possibilities and how to use the public environment as a playground / jungle gym instead of just a static, socially controlled environment. I would lead a class that helped students see the natural and built infrastructure around them as something to explore through exercise. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Grier Barnes<br/>Yale University<br/>Junior<br/>grier.barnes@yale.edu</td><td>I'm friends with Kenta and a bunch of other students on the initial GAKKO excursion; after seeing pictures and hearing stories, I was intrigued and wanted to go myself. I also have a lot of conventional teaching experience--having designed and implemented two seminars this past summer, I figured it would be interesting to think a little bit more out of the box this summer.</td><td>Having finished a law degree and having lived far away from New Haven (and particularly from New York), I will be working as a legal advisor for counterterrorism strategic teams on the ground. The hot spots of terrorism in the 10 years will most likely still be Pakistan but also Mali, a place of relative expertise for me as I speak French. I hope to live there and conduct research on terrorism recruitment while acting as a director and guide for teams to execute their plans in a way that complies with domestic and international law. </td><td>Rainbow Nations: Graffiti, Tattoos, and Race</td><td>South Africa is a country focused on its appearance, both in history and today-- and in both positive and negative ways. Since apartheid, the rainbow nation has struggled with its new visual legacy, particularly amongst her youth. In recent years, a remarkable phenomenon has occurred where young South Africans are tattooing their skin and covering their cities with graffiti to a prolific degree. These two artforms allow the youth of this state, ravaged by race conflict, to reappropriate their country--visually. My class would focus on the racial subtext of urban art--tattoos and graffiti-- in South Africa and then around the world. [sorry Kenta, I know this is sort of scatter-brained. I can explain this idea to you in a better way when I have more time, today is just super cramped!]

  <tr><td>Anna Meixler<br/>Yale University<br/>Freshman <br/>anna.meixler@yale.edu</td><td>I’m fascinated by the ways in which Eastern and Western thought, culture, education and people both overlap and differ. I want to connect with students from vastly different backgrounds in an environment that encourages exploration to see how influences have shaped our outlooks on life and learning. I’d love to have the opportunity to show other students the visual-art inspired lens through which I learn and react, as well as teach students accustomed to a rote learning system about the merits and possibilities of liberal arts education, challenging them to articulate their own thoughts about and approaches to learning. 
  Though I’m interested in exposing others to my way of thinking and new forms of scholarship, I want to communally explore the similarities and essentially human ways that all students challenge and change their outlooks. As I form relationships with students and encourage them to incorporate visual thinking into their learning, I want to build the strong friendships that GAKKO enables. I want to pursue the symbiotic growth that I’d find through GAKKO, and am interested in learning about Japanese culture, allowing my own notions of education to change and find enrichment from trip participants. 
  I’m really excited by the prospect of spending time with peers who have lives very different from mine, educationally, culturally, and geographically. I think the diversity of the GAKKO community and shared enthusiasm of its staff and students makes for an eye-opening and enlightening summer, both inside and outside of the classroom. I think it’s profound and electrifying to find parts of myself in others who are very different, and it’s moving when people who have had experiences that vary from my own relate to me. GAKKO’s construct ensures that this cultural exchange is made all the more impactful by placing students in a world where they can seriously express themselves and important topics without inhibition, connecting on deep levels and molding one another’s lives during a crucial time in young adulthood.</td><td>I see myself continuing to pursue my deep interests in travel, advocacy through art, and cultural connection. Having studied, working with, and formed relationships with Eritrean, south Sudanese, and Darfuri refugees in Israel, I continue to work closely with an Eritrean refugee, Freta, in New Haven. I’m interested in refugee law and the migration and assimilation of peoples. I want to explore new countries and cultures, expanding my worldview and understanding of global conflict. I see myself devoting energies to facilitate the integration of asylum seekers internationally, through which I hope to learn about the histories and ways of others and share parts of my own cultural identity. I see myself continuing to paint and draw portraits that evoke the challenges and pride of different demographics, communicating international issues to public audiences and using visual art, which I think is intensely important, as a powerful tool for communication. In this way I’d like to continue to involve friends and family members in my interests in refugee migration and art, globalizing the conversations I have locally.</td><td>Silent Articulation</td><td>Expressing oneself wordlessly is an essential skill that isn’t taught in most schools. Students are trained to speak and write about ideas, but are rarely pushed to express themselves without language. Without words, students can feel lost, unable to convey their thoughts. It takes reflection and practice to tap into worlds of silent communication, but doing so opens realms of exchange. I express myself best pictorially, and find that when I challenge my friends to do the same, they communicate facets of themselves I didn’t know prior. Without the safety of language, students find then show new parts of themselves and their thinking. I feel vulnerable and empowered when I draw, and think visual representation is a skill vital to one’s ability to express oneself fully and imaginatively.
  Students will be challenged to think visually. They will be given time to silently study and then discuss what they see in drawings, photographs and paintings of people that represent a diverse array of art geographically, stylistically and historically. Examples may include the paintings Guernica (Picasso), Green Stripe (Matisse), Mary Little, Later Lady Carr (Gainsborough), An Old Man in a Military Costume (Rembrandt), Portrait of Yoritomo (Takanobu), To Listen To Reason (Ogembo) and Turquoise Marilyn (Warhol). Students will explain what they feel the images communicate, identifying the ideas or emotions they associate with the subject. We’ll discuss the role of the artist in capturing images, and, envisioning themselves in this role, students will discuss challenges one faces while visually depicting another person. The students will choose images from those presented to which they relate or to which they cannot, and express why they feel a connection or lack thereof with the object.
  Students will then independently choose an idea, emotion, or philosophy that resonates with them, and sketch or write about how they can capture the essence of that abstraction visually. In pairs, students will be challenged to silently articulate one another. The posing students will express their idea or emotion through facial and bodily expression, while the recording students will analyze and interpret the silent evocations of their partners, conveying them through drawing, painting, or photography. 
  The class will be equally accessible to all students, regardless of their backgrounds in art, as they will be encouraged not to represent others by drawing them literally but by presenting the essence of the idea or emotion they perceive in whatever way compels them. Students will be given different mediums for their project. 
  Students will then have time to silently view one another’s work, which will be hung and celebrated gallery-style. Once everyone has viewed the visuals and deduced their own interpretations of what the subject and artist have tried to convey, students will present their work. Together, the pairs will explain both what the subject was focusing on and what the artist perceived, and discussions will ensue. We’ll talk about whether one felt understood as a subject, whether one felt understanding as an artist, and about the limitations and freedoms inherent in capturing an idea visually.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ian Maya Panchèvre<br/>Yale College<br/>Junior<br/>ianpanchevre@gmail.com</td><td>I first learned about Gakko from friends who are currently at Yale. Curiosity prompted me to explore Gakko and I quickly realized that my personal views towards education and mentorship were very much reflected in the spirit of the program. One could say that I’ve taken a non-traditional path in life. When I was 18, I arrived at Yale with confidence and determination to squeeze all of juice that the next four years had to offer. However, by the end of my sophomore year, I began to feel uncertainty about the end goals of my education. Concerned that I was simply going through the motions, without really grasping the larger picture, I decided to take a year off from college to build perspective and return with a renewed sense of spirit. However, I eventually found out that not everything in life proceeds in a linear fashion. My single year off became three, when, during the course of the first year, I ended up founding a technology startup in the nascent and fantastically exciting smartphone application space. Over the past few years, I have been on a journey that included over 2 million dollars in funding, at one point a staff of 20 individuals, a product launch in a major market, litigation, layoffs, technology setbacks… the list goes on and on. Recently, the project had to wind down due to my inability to position the company so that it could secure long-term capital. Now, I am working on a few small projects to occupy my time before I return to Yale in the Fall of 2013. Despite the end-result, I feel blessed to have had the opportunity that I did. For 24 months, I experienced a remarkable entrepreneurial journey; filled with ups and downs, as well as inspiring, talented, and accomplished people. I learned so much about sales, marketing, finance, corporate law, litigation, human resources, operations, management, product design, and software development. Through the entire process, my perspective on education and myself changed entirely. And now, I hope to share my views with others. I’ve always believed in the mentor-mentee relationship. I’ve benefited from a number of great mentors who committed a lot of their time and resources to help me grow. And I’m happy to have built relationships with other individuals whom I, in turn, have been able to help. Gakko seems like an amazing experience to work with others as we jointly explore what it means to “learn” and how to make the most out of one’s “education,” in whatever form it happens to present itself. </td><td>After my experiences away from Yale, I can say without equivocation that I am a creative. However, my platform is neither a canvas nor a stage, but rather, a business. I see myself as a serial entrepreneur. I plan to constantly examine the world around me, identify problems and inefficiencies, and champion bold and creative solutions. I will measure myself by the number of people I have impacted for the better and the degree of change I was able to force upon a broken status quo. </td><td>The Road Less Traveled By: Exploring the Educational Approaches of Extraordinary Individuals</td><td>Much of Western society is conditioned to believe that the path towards financial success and personal accomplishment includes, without exception, traditional education. Countless individuals have collected degrees from one college or another to eventually learn that they are either unprepared for the “real world,” unable to “get a job,” or are personally unsatisfied. And yet, some of the most extraordinary individuals of the past and present pursued alternative educational paths that, in the words of Robert Frost’s The Road Not Taken, “has made all the difference.” Given a full day to work with young minds, I would briefly explore the various approaches towards education pursued by made some of the world’s most gifted minds and accomplished individuals. I would survey the legendary entrepreneurs (Jobs, Gates, Dell, Branson, and Zuckerberg), the political geniuses (Lincoln, Rove, and Truman), the artists (Dickens, Tolstoy, and Poe), the scientists and inventors (Edison, Einstein, Franklin, and Disney), the life-long learners (Buffett, Carnegie, Blair, Clinton, and Churchill), and great mentor-mentee relationships (Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). We would explore common themes – life as a classroom, failure as a great mentor, the pursuit of opportunity, and the habit of self-education. I would also dedicate time to group work, during which students would focus on one individual to disect and discern that individual’s unique philosophy towards education. During the course of the day, I would hope to impress a new perspective towards education and challenge previously held beliefs. The perspective I would hope the students would embrace would not include the mistaken belief that “to become a billionaire, you must drop out of school.” But rather, a perspective which values perpetual learning, the pursuit of new experiences and skills, exposure to challenges, acceptance of failure, and regular introspection to fuel personal growth. Finally, I would be sure to localize the course by including individuals who are of particular relevance to the audience’s geography and culture. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Henry Bryan Epps<br/>Yale<br/>Junior<br/>hbepps@gmail.com</td><td>I'm friends with a large number of last year's team, and they've exposed me to the range of experiences Gakko can offer.  I'm interested in education techniques, education reform, and experimental schooling, and I spent last summer in Africa working for a nonprofit dedicated to experiential learning for underprivileged youth.  I hope to game from Gakko, by working with some of Japan's most talented students, an entirely different perspective on alternative education from my experience last summer.  </td><td>I try not to make plans, and I certainly don't have any specific expectations of myself in 10 years.  What I can give are examples of what I would love to be doing. (1) I would love to be the legal advisor or the manager of a regional counterterrorism unit for the american state department or for the UN.  (2) I would also love to work for Southern Poverty Law Center, which uses lawsuits to bankrupt American hate groups.  (3)  Finally, I can see myself running a small business of some sort--one where I have complete control over the direction and growth of the company, where I don't need to work through extensive bureaucratic systems to accomplish my goals.  </td><td>Lessons in Applied Theater</td><td>My class is called lessons in applied theater.  With this class, I do not hope so much to initiate an interest in theater, while this will certainly be a bonus, but rather to instill in the students a resolute self-confidence, embodied by their abilities to enunciate, project their voices, and express themselves physically and vocally.  Also, vital to theater is cooperation; after taking my class, every student should be able to better collaborate with others—should know when and how to step into leadership roles and when and how to follow a good leader.  Additionally, this class, with its focus on verbal control and enunciation, will be ideal for students working to improve English abilities and confidence in their English abilities. 
  I’ve chosen to create this particular program because I want to share with as many people as I can what was for me the most transformative and meaningful educational experience of my adolescent life.  Entering ninth grade I was reserved and generally lacked self-confidence.  On a whim I signed up for an introductory theater class.  I had no prior acting interest or experience, but my teacher promised this was actually a good thing.  “Most of you will probably take this class and never act again,” he noted, “and that’s perfectly fine.  What I want you to gain from this class is physical and verbal confidence.  I want all of you to be able to stand in front of a crowd of thousands and know that you are in complete control of your body.”  Acting, he explained, is about understanding the capabilities of one’s body and about learning to access what is real—physically, verbally, and emotionally.  Now, I assure you this seemed complete nonsense at first.  I didn’t believe a word of it.  Fortunately for me I wasn’t allowed to express my disbelief for the first two weeks of class because Mr. Van Deusen had not yet allowed us to speak.  “How can you speak with confidence if you can’t yet carry your bodies with confidence?”  He gradually broke down our socio-physical barriers and taught us to become the masters of our own bodies.  
  	One day, at last, he granted us our first word. SOME. We learned to say this word with absolute precision backed by the full power of our diaphragms.  Phrase-by-phrase we learned Robert Frost’s poem in its entirety, “Some say the world will end in fire…” A few months after our first word, even the most timid among us stood confidently in front of the entire class, alone, under a spotlight, and performed a monologue.  The transformation in every one of us was astonishing.   Every student deserves access to this kind of confidence.  MIT Professor Patrick Winston notes, “Your careers will be determined largely by how well you speak, by how well you write, and by the quality of your ideas…in that order.” It is my goal to help students improve their self-presentation by changing the way they think about public speaking.

  <tr><td>Uriel Kejsefman<br/>Yale <br/>Junior<br/>uriel.kejsefman@yale.edu</td><td>My interests stems mainly from my larger commitment to education. As an international student from Argentina, I feel my Yale education has shaped my life in ways I can barely describe. Yet, this kind of education, as in Japan, is inaccessible and unimaginable in Argentina. I’ve come to believe that an education must be a formative process far beyond opening the door to a career, and so I have concluded that reforming education is probably the most important kind of a change my country needs. Education has ever since been my intellectual and personal passion. It has translated, for example, into a senior thesis focused on reflecting and assessing the value of a liberal arts education. 
  Discussing Gakko with a variety of past participants has showed me that there is something new and possibly revolutionary in this project. Gakko seems revolutionary in its critique and open rebellion against established models of education. I don’t think it’s alone. From Yale-NUS to virtual education, I see education in general undergoing a larger process of self-revision. Self-introspection can only lead to redefinition. Change is on the making.
  I want to be part of Gakko because I can see and feel this project is not only engaging in the kind of questions that have lately defined my own interest, but it is also creating something utterly novel and possibly enlightening. I seriously think I have much to add and contribute to the evolution, growth and success of this project. I truly hope to have the honor of becoming part of it. </td><td>I am not sure. I plan to work for a couple of years, probably get skills in management, before heading for double degree in Public Administration and Education. Where that will lead me, I still don’t know and it’s possibly unrealistic to predict. But I imagine it will keep me in track of a career that I hope leads me to first build skills and knowledge for myself, that I can later use and translate for the benefit of many others, whether back home or elsewhere. </td><td>The Ultimate Question</td><td>Questioning is the soul and essence of the Western tradition. From the time Socrates founded Western philosophy on the premise that all beliefs must be questioned, to Gakko’s challenge of modern education, we have inherited a spirit of doubt and open inquiry. While this is not an exclusive property of the West, it is nonetheless the most profound lesson our tradition can teach. 

  Questioning is most meaningful when applied to life. Not life in general, or in the abstract, but one’s own. Rationalized or not, every human life is built upon a set of principles and values which most essentially define who we are. Some are inherited, some will change through our lives, and some will never be understood. All of them will haunt you and define you far more significantly than your DNA until your last breath.  Questioning the meaning your life is the most important journey you will ever embark upon; education’s fundamental task is to aide in this journey. 

  We will do it together. Daunting like nothing else and with higher stakes than any other journey you will ever take, you will share this voyage with the brightest minds of humanity. Luckily, they all embarked on this journey before us, and will give us clues on to where we may be heading. Of course the ideas of Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Sartre will be featured. Along with Christ and the Buddha. Michelangelo, Dostoyevsky, Vivaldi, Einstein, and Thoreau. The Beatles, the Matrix and Monty Python. Your parents, your first love, and your childhood’s dream. 

  And you. Most importantly you. Because ultimately you cannot delegate the responsibility nor obtain an answer from anyone but yourself. Others like you will join you, with their own stories, fears and insights. Together, we will travel Gericault’s raft, head to the Last Judgment, and write our own epitaph; escape Dukkha, go live with Walden in nature, question God and face the consequences; love everyone as ourselves, and let it be. 

  Only a life of meaning is a life worth living. Our lives are the most precious resource we possess, and the question on how to spend them is the most important we face. You may feel you have awakened from a life unreal as a dream; you may get lost for a while; or you may find yourself forever. 
  You are invited. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximilian Gordon<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>maximilian.gordon@yale.edu</td><td>During Camp Yale I sat down in Saybrook dining hall and I asked Nathaniel Toppelberg about his summer. He exploded with something about teaching these kids in Japan holy fucking shit it was so cool. It fit a certain genre of Yale summers: exotic, mildly altruistic, and looks good on a resume. I didn’t think much of it. But later in the semester he told me about the philosophy behind Gakko—the innovation, the questioning, the creativity. I wanted to be involved.

  Not all schools should be the same. My first school was a one-room adobe house. Every year ten Tibetan monks came to stay with our families. Together we created a sand mandala and sang about the love in our heart of hearts. In fourth grade we would hitch up our carabineers and spend all day in the top of a tree. I didn’t know how to type on a computer until I was tenth grade. But I did know the feel of bark and how to avoid the whiplash of a branch and hunch down and approach a peacock, hand outstretched, always looking at its plumage.

  When I was fourteen my family moved and went to a four-thousand person suburban public high school. I did the standardized tests and that early-May cramming for AP’s I didn’t really care about. This approach to education has its merits. But all students should have the opportunity to experience something different, something beyond little bubbles and number-two pencils. I’m not interested in policy reform or educational bureaucracy. But I am a firm believer in a different idea of "school." I want to spread this belief.
  </td><td>	Right now, I see myself creating music that we hear on the radio. This is what I want to do with my life. But interests change, other passions grow, and I recognize that a nineteen-year-old’s foresight is affected (maybe even bettered) by certain youthful romanticisms. It’s cliché, but I knowing myself I can say that in ten years I’m going to be doing what I’m most passionate about at that time.</td><td>Creating Top 40</td><td>Popular music is usually seen one of two ways: “Taylor Swift is great. All her songs are so good!” A superficial appreciation without listening or thinking deeper. Or there is the more neo-Marxist/anti-capitalist perspective: We are capitalist pawns, consuming the superficial, formulaic creations of executives in conglomerate boardrooms—the cultural kingmakers. While this perspective is more thoughtful than the first, it ignores what music ultimately is: art. This class will create a deeper understanding of the ever-present music in our lives.

  	We’ll being by looking at current popular music, including Katy Perry, Ke$ha, and Girls Generation. Much of what we hear today—including Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Ke$ha, Taio Cruz, and Talyor Swift—is created by the same team of writers. We’ll analyze similarities and differences in these artists, focusing on melody, rhythm, and overall production. Then we’ll discuss what makes each artist unique, and how certain factors contribute to branding of that artist. For example, the increased presence of electronic, danceable beats on Taylor Swift’s latest album was a deliberate decision to help her image grow into what audiences consider the sound of a “more mature” artist, while the continued presence of teenage-themed lyrics (“We are never, ever, ever getting back together”) and acoustic guitar keeps her from losing the branding that makes her unique. Students will talk about what they associate with an artist and how musical factors come together to create and support that image, focusing also on K-Pop and the influence of music industry mega-corporations in “creating” starts.

  	These songs are created through a multi-step process, in which producers make a track, hook specialists come in to write the chorus, and different lyricists and melody writers work on different sections of the song. This process is usually overseen by one producer, who has final say over the finished product, often modifying certain parts of the song to fit a particular artist’s image. 

  After we have looked at this process the class will divide into groups to create their own pop song chorus. Each group will play the role of producer, assembling different components to create a song. Each production team will first pick its own pre-made and then select from a number of pre-made chord progressions, deciding which one sounds best for the sound they want to achieve. Then, each will pick from standard pre-made rhythms for the melody (the same certain rhythms are used in most pop songs, for example the choruses of “Tik Tok” and “California Gurls,” or “Dynamite” and “Starships”). I will make each track and part before hand so that the groups can at least ten options for every step of the process. Then, each group will select an artist for the song—or even create its own imaginary artist—and write lyrics for the rhythm with the brand image of the artist in mind. This won’t require knowledge of music, just the ability to analyze what sounds best to each student and then piece these parts together.

  At the end of class, each group will present its pop song to the class. This leads to the larger question of why popular things are popular and to what degree we are in control of our own musical tastes.

  <tr><td>Katarina Sandberg<br/>Uppsala University<br/>Sophomore<br/>katarina.sandberg@hotmail.com</td><td>What made me interested in GAKKO is the fact that I have been starting to question my own learning. When I first started high-school I had a  five year plan ahead of me. I was going to study the natural science program in high-school, work hard and get good grades and then I would go straight to Stockholm School of Economics. Not because I wanted to, but because it was what I saw as the road to success and success to me was money and social status. Me and all the other super ambitious girls in my class came to high school with similar plans. For us there were only three options; you could either be a doctor, a lawyer or go into business. We never questioned those options, we never questioned anything, we never questioned learning. 

  After high school I got a scholarship for one year of studies at a college in Atlanta. I did not know if to accept it, on one hand it was a great adventure and a very generous offer with free tuition, food, housing, books and more. On the other hand it was a whole year “wasted” on a university no one outside Georgia had ever heard of. After a lot of shilly-shallying I decided to accept the offer. It was the best decision of my life, and I have never learned as much as I did that year. 

  We were 55 students from all over the world who received the scholarship and ended up at 30 different schools around Georgia. In Sweden everything is extremely focused on what you will work with later on in life, i.e. if you are to become a lawyer you do not study anything but law. In Georgia everything was different, I took classes in things I probably will not work with in the future; history, art, psychology. 

  The interesting part was that what I learned from, more than anything else, was the meetings with the other scholars during the weekends. We all had different backgrounds, we were of different ages, we all came from different countries and we all had our own view on the country and state we had ended up in. My time in Georgia made me realize a lot of things about learning and education. I understood that the fastest and straightest way to the goal is not always the most rewarding or right way. I understood that everything you learn will help you in your life and future career, even if a class may seem irrelevant at first. Most of all I understood that you learn the most in the encounters with other people, especially the ones that have a very different background then your own. 

  Today we tend to measure everything in terms of effectiveness and with our education system we tend to cast everyone in the same mould. I've realized how many great ideas that gets lost in the process and therefore I want to question both my own and other's learning. Therefore I want to be a part of Gakko 2013.
  </td><td>Like I mentioned earlier, I was completely sure what I wanted to do a few years ago. I had my life planned. Nowadays I tend to change my plan every other day. What I am sure of is that I do not want to bound myself to one profession and then do that for the rest of my life. I know I want to spend my life trying to figure this world out, that is why I am interested in political science and international relations. My other big interest is writing and communication. My dream is to combine them in some way. I might work for some kind of international organization, with public relations, communication or as a journalist. I think that the most interesting thing you can do with your life is to create something yourself, I am very interested in entrepreneurship and my dream is to start my own magazine or publishing house (even though I know that those lines of businesses are dying right now). I know that whatever field I choose to work in I always want to have a writing project going on, I want to work as an author for the rest of my life.</td><td>How to Not Become a Writer and How That Makes You One</td><td>In today's society communication is faster than ever before. We express ourselves through status updates on Facebook or through Twitter. Will the development of this fast, internet-based media lead to the death of printed media and books? I assert that it is the other way around, today there are more books published than ever before. It seems like everyone has a dream of writing a novel before they die. Since no one knows when they are going to die it seems like a better idea to start writing on a novel right now. So I did, two years ago.

  I have just turned 20 and my first novel is getting published in the spring. Everyone keeps asking me how it happened and I do not know what to tell them. I know what the answer should be: To get a novel published you need to a) take a thousand writing classes, b) read all the classics and c) be born with the right genes. Neither of that appeals to me. I've never taken a writing class in my life, I never been interested in the literature you should read and my parents works as a physical therapist respectively in the textile industry. Despite this I make my debut in April. 

  And that is where my class comes in, this class is not like any other creative writing class. I am not going to talk about metaphors and turning points and alliteration. I am not going to force anyone to read any nobel prize winners or analyze short stories by Kafka. Your english teacher will know more about those things than I ever will (especially since english is not my maternal language).

  But I will talk about things that your english teacher knows nothing about. I will talk about the importance of being naive. About how I was sure that 100 hours was enough to write a novel even though my swedish teacher tried to convince me that it was not (turned out she was right). I will talk about how super creepy mails (that I finished with the sentence ”I'm not related to you, I don't have contacts in the publishing business, I haven't had a sexual relationship with you – but I still hope that you will give my manuscript an honest chance”) led to several meetings with publishing houses. How I got my favorite author to read and comment on my manuscript. How I got nominated three times for Sweden's biggest literature award for young people and how I ended up in the very north of Sweden, 12 hours from home, just because of a short story. 

  I will talk about how you have nothing to lose (except a little bit of dignity) when you want to achieve something. There will be a 1000 people writing e-mails by the book. In this class I will talk about what happens when you do things the opposite way instead, when you are not competing with those 1000 people. This class is about all the things I shouldn't have done if I wanted to become a writer and how I did them and became a writer anyway.

We will question the reason that humans require sleep and discover the illnesses that affect a majority of our sleep-deprived nation. We will also read milestone scientific articles and put their findings to the test! Does a ten minute nap really confer cognitive benefits? We shall see. We will design and conduct our own experiments to test hypotheses about specific sleep questions as the final class project.

  In our study of nutrition, we will investigate the chemistry and physics governing the kitchen. Why does bread rise? How many calories are in a slice of cake? With delicious hands-on experiments, we will work together to find out.</td></tr>

I think this attitude needs to change, and GAKKO provides an interesting model that helps students think differently about learning as well as reexamine what they may take for granted in their daily life. In addition, I am excited about the opportunity that GAKKO offers to me personally to experience a completely different culture and environment. It would be wonderful to be able to combine my interest and skills in the arts with exploration of a different cultural perspective.</td><td>In ten years, I see myself either in a youth-oriented nonprofit organization or in a book publishing or illustration job. I am open to various possibilities, but I am most interested in applying or integrating the arts with life. I am primarily interested in illustration and how it can be used to communicate, whether in books or on book covers, or on posters and graphics, or even in alternate approaches to education. Visual impact is something that can completely change someone's perspective or mood.</td><td>Design Your Life: Re-imagining Product Packaging</td><td>Every day in our consumer-oriented culture, we walk past aisles and aisles of products that scream for our attention (and money). Some of them communicate better to us: they make us stop and pick them up, take a closer look, maybe remember a good experience, or just admire the artwork. At other times, they tell us a bit more - advising us that using or buying that product will help the environment, or make us more responsible citizens. Sometimes we walk away with them to the checkout counter; other times we put them back on the shelf.

  Product packaging is easy to take for granted, because it is everywhere. Yet it can be a powerful means of communication and involves many elements of design. Color, form, typography, branding, and illustration combine to convey multiple messages. Which messages take priority? What makes packaging effective - is it as simple as getting the consumer to buy the product, or is there more to it? Packaging also appeals to different cultural values and aesthetics, so what does packaging say about the society or group that it targets?

  My class will aim to help students learn some basic tools of design and apply them towards redesigning packaging for a favorite product, or possibly even a product that doesn't yet exist, but they believe should be developed. This class requires a lot of creativity - how else can we make a product stand out from the thousands crowded onto the shelves? - but also involves discussion about important topics such as relevance, environmental responsibility, marketing, and, of course, the role that art plays in daily life. We can also look at works by designers in a diverse variety of fields for inspiration.</td></tr>

I feel like I owe my most crucial learning experiences not to school but to the creative process and the highly inspirational teachers I've been lucky enough to have as mentors and confidantes. Also, participating in the Telluride Association Summer Program the summer of my junior year in high school --a program very similar to GAKKO in its spirit of bringing motivated students together in a tight-knit, community-oriented learning environment-- has completely changed the way I look at learning. I am convinced that rethinking the education system is the single most important thing that needs to be done today, and am very excited about the opportunity to be in dialogue about this with a group of amazing people, spanning a range of ages and backgrounds. Being from Istanbul, I am also interested in thinking about how a program like GAKKO can be used as a blueprint and be replicated in different cultural settings.</td><td>Active member of a cutting-edge contemporary theater company in Istanbul or starving in New York. Nothing in between.</td><td>Presence</td><td>“Theater is the capacity possessed by human beings –and not by animals- to observe themselves in action.”
  --Augusto Boal

  “Where are you?” 
  --God (Genesis, 3:9)

  They have just eaten the fruit of knowledge; just realized that they are naked. This is what they get from God: Where are you? At the crucial moment when Adam and Eve epitomize their humanity, they become aware of their surroundings, their context, their nudity, their vulnerability—they are forced to seize their presence. And today, amidst distractions of past regrets and reconciliations, future plans and aspirations, we struggle to do the same. We forget to ask ourselves: Where am I? 

  I love theater, because I think it is a way of asking ourselves that question and reconnecting with our presence. At its best, it allows each participant, both actor and audience member, to share a space, to have a clear focus, to have an equal and free exchange of feelings and ideas—to be present with each other. I would like to capture this heightened level of attentiveness and connectivity through an interactive workshop of improvisational games and exercises. 
   
  Theater practitioner Augusto Boal, who developed the Theater of the Oppressed technique, drew from these principles to explore how performance can be used to generate dialogue about societal issues concerning anyone and everyone. He regarded theater as a “rehearsal for reality” and worked with students, convicts, workers, actors—groups of all shapes and sizes—to address issues of local and global concern. He created the technique of Forum Theater, where the boundary between actor and spectator is blurred, and everyone becomes a ‘spect-actor’. In a Forum Theater session, a problem of common concern is chosen (this can be anything from cheating husbands to gender inequality in job opportunities) and presented in the form of a sketch, which can be interjected by any of the spect-actors to propose a different course of action by acting out what their own idea. This flexible process generates dialogue about the issue, getting everyone to actively interact with each other’s ideas and be present. 

  In the workshop, I’d like to use this method and other Theater of the Oppressed techniques to think about what education is and how we, as the ones who are supposed to be receiving it, want it to be –or not be- systemized. In this process, we will get in touch with our presence, ask the questions that are worth asking and work together to create an end product.

  Why is all of this important or relevant? Because we are nothing but the meaningful connections we establish—with ourselves, the people around us, the things we are passionate about. And connection happens not in the past or the future, but in the tangible, breathing, precious here and now. To me, there is no better reminder of this than theater. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Geoffrey Litt<br/>Yale University<br/>Junior<br/>geoffrey.litt@yale.edu</td><td>Being close friends with Kenta and others who did GAKKO last year, I've heard a lot about the core mission behind the project, and I firmly believe that it is a well-guided, important mission. I grew up for much of my childhood in Japan, where I was able to witness firsthand the type of traditional mindset regarding education that is so prevalent there. Really, though, it is just an extreme manifestation of a mindset that prevails worldwide.

  You only have to look as far as Yale and other top American universities to reach this conclusion. Despite all the great things about our school, the primary method of education is still to make a bunch of kids sit in a room and listen to a professor tell them facts, and that is foolish. One of my best experiences at Yale was a seminar called Great Big Ideas where we watched online videos about topics in advance, and then discussed the videos in class. This unconventional classroom format, combined with a great professor, led to an EXPLOSION of new ideas, and I am eager to figure out more and more ways to make ideas EXPLODE like that, so that others can experience the beauty of that phenomenon, and so that I can see it again for myself too.

  GAKKO is designed with exactly this in mind, and I think that participating in the program would be a great opportunity to experiment with education in a fun, unbounded way. I also appreciate that the program takes place in my home country of Japan, because I have a particular desire to help modern ideas of education take root there specifically.</td><td>In 10 years, I see myself working in the technology industry, perhaps running my own company. I could give you noble reasons like helping the world make progress, and perhaps those have some merit in my mind, but the real core reason is DELIGHT. It simply delights me to create a new technological system and see it work, to see people use it, and even sometimes, when I'm lucky, to see people be delighted by it. Creation is addictive.

  And this delight doesn’t just apply to my own creation. I love watching progress take place in the world, as groups of people delve deep into their own creativity to produce things that no one could have predicted. These things could be as seemingly trivial as Facebook, or as obviously meaningful as a cure for cancer, but they are all creations, and they are all exquisite manifestations of the human spirit. Anything a human creates is, in some way, art.

  I think that delight is one of the greatest feelings in the world, and I want to convey the delight of creation to students in the GAKKO program. They probably won’t be delighted by the same things I am, but that’s kind of the point. I just want to convey to them, “go find the thing that makes you smile uncontrollably and jump up and down…and pursue that thing forever.”</td><td>The World in 2050</td><td>“The World in 2050” is a class about having a vision, and delighting in creation.

  The word “vision”, especially in its alternate form, “visionary”, seems to have become somewhat cliché recently. But it is an important word, for the river of time is ever rushing forward, and while a blind man can sometimes get down the river okay (http://nyti.ms/RPh7Bx), I think you would agree that it is better to have some vision of where we want to go, as a world and as a species. This is not a task that any small group of leaders can achieve; I truly believe that the onus is on every human to contribute to this grand vision, even in the tiniest ways.

  So the first goal of “The World in 2050” is to encourage students to think in the long term about the future of the Earth, and decide what type of future they want to live in. I remember as a child being asked to draw a picture of the future world. Why don’t teachers ask us that anymore? It is because we are all boring now, and we all know what is possible and what is impossible. Thus, the first task in “The World in 2050” is to break into groups and draw their ideal vision of the world in 2050 on a large sheet of paper. Students can draw any type of scene they want – a bedroom, a house, a city, the whole world. 

  After this is done, we will regroup, and each small group will present their drawing and explain several things that they drew. The other groups will ask them tough questions about what they included and why. The only questions that will not be allowed are questions about HOW. Screw how, we’ll figure it out. Nothing is impossible to implement in this ideal world.

  The second goal of “The World in 2050” is to allow students to experience the joy of creation. This part is not as fully defined yet, but the crux of it is to have students design a specific product that exists in 2050, and looks nothing like anything that exists today. It could be a flying car or the next Tupperware, whatever. It is their chance to become designers, inventors, product managers, and artists. The students will split up into groups and think about what they want to design, given the conclusions of the first part of the class. 

  They will draw pictures of the product, and perhaps even make a crude model out of basic art supplies if available. Once again, the implementation details are not important. All that is important is for the students to justify the existence of that object, to justify every detail of its design. By the end of this process, each group will present their product, and they will hopefully be delighted by what they have created, and what others have come up with as well.

  My hope would be for every student to walk out with a little more of a vision they walked in with, and some idea of what they could create to work towards that vision.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Paavan Gami<br/>Yale <br/>Sophomore<br/>paavan.gami@yale.edu</td><td>I was fortunate enough to coach the South Korean national debate team as well as teach debate skills to a broader set of middle school students this past December. The experience was incredibly fulfilling, both for me and my students. Seeing the students tangibly improve over such a short period was amazing, particularly because their school systems had not at all exposed them to the sort of critical thinking that debate espouses. In that sense, I had the rare opportunity to expose these kids to a whole new perspective on education. GAKKO is an opportunity to similarly expose Japanese youth to an innovative educational paradigm that can truly change their lives. The Koreans I worked with have taken the initiative to establish an inner city debate league, are engaged politically in their cities, and are just generally more active citizens of their communities as a result of a mere three week program. I know that programs like GAKKO work, precisely because they do not define their goals in terms of knowledge that must be imparted but rather in terms of growth in whatever direction a given experience demands of its participants. I'm particularly excited about the creative control that is given to teachers in that sense to tailor curriculums to what students need, to make learning truly dynamic. This, to me, is what education should be about. GAKKO is unique in that it not only brings crucial exposure to youth, but it also serves as an idea incubator for the teachers. As someone interested in improving civic education in the US (and around the world), GAKKO is the perfect place for me to see first hand what the youth of a very modern country are craving in terms of learning outside of school, what they themselves see as necessary and important skills. That understanding, derived from tangible interactions with students rather than some sort of top-down speculation on what type of learning is useful, empowers real education. GAKKO is something I would be proud to be a part of.
  </td><td>I'd like to go law school and eventually work towards reforming markets to be more socially productive. Ideally, that'll happen in the context of a start-up focused on socially responsible investing/social entrepreneurship. 
  </td><td>The art of argument - articulating your beliefs </td><td>All of my life, I have identified as a debater. As a high school student, I was the National Forensics League Student of the Year runner-up and I won a national championship my freshman year at Yale in my division. More than the accolades though, that identification comes through the way I have viewed the world, in terms of perspectives and shades of gray rather than objective truths. Certainly, participating in debate has been useful in an academic sense, in writing essays quickly, in meaningfully participating in discussion sections, in digesting papers etc. More than that though, I think the most useful skill that I can impart from debate is how to articulate arguments effectively, depending on the audience and context. This skill is crucial to engaging in any political context and one I think would be especially valuable to Japanese youth given the otherwise memorization-focused pedagogy in Japan. In one of the most technologically innovative countries in the world, young people empowered to express themselves will be a force to reckon with. 

  The reason I think learning to construct arguments is so fundamental is that it acts as the gateway towards being able to question the status quo. In general, kids in a standard Japanese education system will be taught little about critical thinking. The problem is that even the ones who do start to think critically and creatively are unable to express themselves clearly and gain recognition for their ideas. This discourages them and stifles further creative thought, especially because regurgitation is far more rewarded in the school setting. Without articulating ideas and having related discourse, it's also tough to refine and improve them. Teaching the participants at GAKKO how to structure their ideas is the first step towards enabling them to engage with each other. Most importantly, it teaches them that their ideas are valuable and worth developing.

  So yes, it'd be great to point a wand at some kids and turn them into critical thinkers but how do you do that in real life? What can I specifically offer as far as teaching argumentation goes? I've been teaching debate related skills for years. In high school, I founded a middle school debate league in South Carolina, running workshops to educate teachers on how to coach as well as individually mentoring students. More recently, I was asked by several Korean university teams to come coach them before the world championships last December. During that time, I also got to use debate as a medium through which I taught younger students English grammar. Through all these experiences, I've accumulated a solid understanding of the most effective teaching methodology: flexibility. Sticking to a rigid curriculum never works, since students have individual needs and interests that can be appealed to for far better results. I hope to teach through vehicles that interest the students in my class specifically and allow them to build up arguments about the things they really care about. It's that sort of thing that gets them to learn. 

  I love GAKKO's focus on individuality and new teaching/learning paradigms, and ultimately, I think my beliefs, experiences, and skills fit well into that context. By equipping students with the ability to articulate their thoughts, we can set them on the path towards questioning learning and much more.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>David Mandelbaum<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>david.mandelbaum@yale.edu</td><td>The statement that is the driving force of GAKKO -- question learning -- has resonated with me since high school.  I have often questioned where I have learned the most: through my academics inside the classroom, through my extracurriculars, or through my personal interests and pursuits?  Although I have had the privilege of being exposed to incredible teachers in high school and college, many of my most influential and transformative learning experiences have been through my other activities.  I have found that the skills that I value highly and strive to constantly develop in myself -- such as the ability to express myself clearly, the ability to work effectively and collaboratively with others, and the ability to be resourceful in problem-solving -- have been honed by these pursuits outside of the classroom.  These activities include Model UN, which has taught me more about the art of persuasion and speaking effectively than anything else I have done; working as a camp counselor for twelve eleven-year-olds last summer, which taught me how to be flexible in working with others (and patience!); and teaching myself how to program in middle school and high school from the internet, which forced me to  be resourceful and hone my ability to learn by doing, instead of by observing, as I had practiced for so many years in school.  Because of how much I have learned from experiences that have taken place outside the classroom, I am very interested in helping others find these experiences for themselves.  The fact that this opportunity is based in Japan, where the primary education system is less interactive and less tolerant of these alternative academic experiences than in the United States, contributes a lot to my excitement about the project -- I believe there is significant potential for having a transformative impact on the kohai who enroll in GAKKO, and I would love to have the chance to share this experience with them.</td><td>In ten years, I would like to be working at a start-up that is at the forefront of discovering innovative solutions to problems in the public sector using the principles of behavioral economics.  I am fascinated by how the mind works: how we perceive the world around us, how we make decisions, and how our emotions have a pervasive impact on what we think is completely rational thinking.  There has been a growing trend over the past decade of using developments in cognitive science to inform work in other fields, and I think this movement has significant implications on a number of different spheres.  Specifically, behavioral economics applies insights into the decision-making process to economic models to accurately determine how humans will behave, and optimize policies accordingly.  I am extremely interested in what new directions this field will go in over the next ten years, and I hope to be working at a startup venture that will use these cognitive insights for good.</td><td>Illusions: Why the world isn't how it seems</td><td>     Everything you do is fundamentally based on your perception of the world.  Your brain -- only three pounds, but containing a hundred billion neurons -- rests inside your skull, constantly taking in information from the outside world.  Your senses of sight, sound, touch, smell and taste are filtered, processed, and stitched together into what you perceive as your consciousness.  This consciousness seems omnipresent, and, more importantly, appears to be a seamless window into the outside world, a perfect representation of what is around us.  In reality, though, what you perceive is not the world around you -- it is your interpretation of it, and it is often dead wrong.
       Illusions are a distortion of the senses, and it is a natural human tendency to be susceptible to them.  Illusions are fascinating; more importantly, though, they can reveal the fundamental inner workings of human cognition, and tell us a great deal about how we think.  I want to teach a class on illusions because I think that everyone should know not only how their mind works, but how their mind doesn't work.  Cognitive illusions can have a huge impact on how we make decisions, and only by being aware of them can we hope to circumvent them.
       I would start by showing the class optical illusions.  They are the easiest way to demonstrate our susceptibility to illusions, both because most people are already familiar with them and because their results are immediately evident in a visual sense.  There a number of popular optical illusions relating to color and brightness, depth perception, and motion perception that can quickly demonstrate that our sense of vision can often betray us.  After showing the class these optical illusions, I would show, for each, what it reveals about perception; for instance, the brightness optical illusions indicate that we perceive brightness not in absolute terms, but in the context of the other colors surrounding it.
       I would then move on to cognitive illusions -- specifically, failures in areas such as memory, thought, and decision-making.  There a number of examples that demonstrate these: the "Asian disease problem" that shows our susceptibility to framing effects, our difficulty in dealing with statistics as opposed to absolute numbers, and our well-documented issues with affective forecasting.  Using these illusions as a guide, I would have the class discuss the illusions, discovering how these cognitive biases works, how to be recognize them, and how to reframe problems and decisions to avoid them.
       To wrap up the class, I would broaden the discussion, showing why illusions teach an important lesson about the necessity of critical thinking.  I would invite each student to come up with a situation in which they were susceptible to these illusions, and present to the class on how they would approach the situation differently now.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Max Efremov<br/>University of Maryland, Baltimore County<br/>Junior<br/>maxim.efremov@gmail.com</td><td>Two people that I have been best friends with since childhood -- Ben Boult and Andrew Nagl -- both attended last year's GAKKO excursion. Ben has the documentary footage which I've only glanced at, but I was immediately captivated on multiple levels -- between the setting, the diversity of thought embodied by the sempai, and the eagerness of the students. Nagl-san told me that the three weeks he was in Japan were the best three weeks of his entire life. Leaving the most positive imprint on this planet and the people in it is the main motivating drive of my life. How could I not have been interested?</td><td>It's hard for me to imagine a specific answer I could give now that I wouldn't laugh at in 10 years from now, but if I had to guess…

  I see myself actively involved in the city in which I live. At this point in my life, I'm still discovering the world at large, yet I know wherever I am in 10 years I'll have an active hand education and shaping the way children learn about the our world. Part of me feels that the job title doesn't exactly exist yet, but something definitely akin to being an educator. A molder. I had and still have a very close relationship with education, and remember how kindergarten, primary, and then secondary school affected me.

  I have quite a distaste for the choices that were made for me when I was younger. Not necessarily by my parents, or even the individual teachers who stood in front of me every day, but for the system that told them not to ask questions. How conforming it was. How it celebrated behaviors in me that I thought to be somewhat tedious at best, and destructive at worst. I don't want that to happen to anyone anymore. I don't want "school" to be the place where dreams are narrowed down and imagination gives way to right answers. If I feel like I’m actively striving to stop that from happening in ten years time, I’ll be a happy camper.</td><td>Out of your Box</td><td>Every one of our waking thoughts and actions are tinted by our "boxes", whether we recognize it or not. The word "box" is apt when describing where exactly the individual perspective resides. Our "boxes" are molded in part by genetics, by our peers, by our culture, the sum total of the boundaries, limitations, and defaults in the way we think. And if you do not make your own decisions, we let our box dictate our actions and reactions.

  This isn't controversial. Most people agree that thinking outside of the box is a good thing. But what is controversial is encouraging students to truly think outside the box, while they’re in class. We've all silently and complacently allowed ourselves to slip into the mindset that radical, productive, purposeful thinking just doesn’t happen in a classroom. You do big things after class or school or college.


  The class would have 2 interrelated parts;

  (1) Physically acting outside one's own box
  (2) Thinking and writing outside one's own box

  Most meaningful growth is done outside of our default. The real growth is done near the edges of our competency or comfort zones, when we extend past our own boundaries of skill, laziness, and fear of failure. And it helps a lot when you're surrounded by people who care and are there to help.

  The primary focus of the class would be self-exploration, coupled with incredible amounts of personalized, individualized, constructive feedback.


  Specifics:

  (1) Our body is the only thing that we really own. Yet to most people, our bodies are nothing more than a vehicle to carry our brains around from place to place. There is a line drawn between our mind and our body, but I hope to introduce the idea that we are nothing without our bodies, and we should utterly respect them, respect them like nothing else we "own". Through fortunate connections and my parents, I am very familiar with gymnastics, stretching, deep breathing, and meditating. Our bodies generally start healthy because of youth, but if we don't develop and maintain good habits, then we are doomed to a kind of life we can scarcely imagine - - trapped in a weak, neglected body.

  I want to show the class how to stretch, breath, walk, and run in a conscious, deliberate way. Powerful, fun, engaging motion through games and group exercise. I figure -- if one starts to "act" outside one's own box, then it should follow that one may start to "think" outside that box, too. Discovering your body develops one of the most important relationships you'll have for the rest of your life.

  (2) The verb "think" is difficult to define. What kind of attention or feedback could one give to a kohai's thought process? I believe the best way to evaluate someone's thoughts is to observe them on paper. The students would put pen to paper, and either through writing or illustrating (or both), they would share ideas with the sempai and others. I would assign a single objective, something to effect of: "Describe an idea that has followed you your whole life"

  The important part is not so much my question (though it always helps to have a good questions!), but getting the student to think deeply about something they truly care about. With this in mind, they then try putting their thoughts on paper. And that process, of transcribing what YOU think and feel into words-and-sentences or lines-and-shapes so that SOMEONE ELSE can feel it too, is the soul of communication. It's the most important, fundamental human activity. If you can get me to feel what you feel, you win. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Stephanie Rivkin<br/>Yale College<br/>Senior <br/>stephanie.rivkin@yale.edu</td><td>Late this summer I stumbled upon a Facebook album that contained photos of a few of my good friends. I flipped through the album, curious about it’s contents. Immediately I could tell that this group of students was having a fantastic time. I continued exploring the album. Not only did they appear to be having an incredible experience in Japan, but from just a few photographs, I could tell that they were making a tremendous difference in the lives of those students with whom they worked. Almost immediately, I thought this sounded like an incredible program, and I knew I wanted to try to be a part of it.</td><td>In 10 years, I see myself working in some part of the small business sector, whether at home or abroad. Post-graduation, I plan to work and travel for a few years before attending business school. With an MBA, I hope to gain more experience in the business world, perhaps working for a larger company, before moving onto what I really want to do. I am fascinated by the small business world, and I want to help people develop their ideas and contribute to this world. Essentially, I want to gain the skills to help people realize their dreams, ideally in areas of the world that will help many other people as well.</td><td>A Look at Conflict-Resolution: Seeing Things from the Other Side</td><td>Have you ever gotten into an argument and refused to acknowledge someone else’s point of view? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to experience a disagreement from the other side? Have you ever criticized someone for his or her viewpoint before really thinking through how or why he or she might see something from a different perspective?

  In order to get the students into the mindset of understanding a different perspective, I would begin the class by assigning students different roles and asking them to act out certain situations. In my opinion, there is significant value in actually understanding a event through being a part of it. Through experiencing tangible encounters (though these will be fabricated) people have a greater ability to actually comprehend the circumstance and to understand and appreciate the outcomes. 

  One of my favorite things that I have ever done is working as a team-building counselor for high school students from conflict zones. For the past two summers I have worked with an organization called Seeds of Peace. The organization is based around a three and a half week summer camp held in the woods of Maine where students from Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan, India, Israel, Pakistan, Palestine, and the US come together to experience coexistence and “the way life could be” in a would-be post-conflict setting. Each day the campers learn new sports and skills, live in cabins together, eat together, and generally get to know each other as people. For two hours per day the students engage in professionally facilitated dialogue sessions where they present their thoughts and stories and hear the thoughts and stories of the people who they previously thought to be their enemies. Now they are their teammates, their bunkmates, and their friends. At the end of the session, the campers emerge with a new perspective on their situation and ideally as leaders of the next generation, whether that means in the realm of politics, media, education, or other.

  Though these students are not necessarily in recognized global conflict with one another, people and groups experience smaller-scale conflicts every day. I think it is extremely valuable to learn to think about the way “the other side” may feel in any given situation. After acting out the first situation, I would change the scenario slightly, and have students switch roles so they could understand how people might feel from a different perspective. Afterward, we would debrief and discuss the various situations.

  Ultimately, I would want the students to come out of the class with a greater understanding of perspective and how different people might feel both going into and emerging from the same scenario. If we decide to make it a class more related to conflict-resolution in the greater world context, I could connect these smaller scenarios to real world global examples.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Kathy Lam Tran<br/>Harvard College<br/>Freshman <br/>kathytran@college.harvard.edu</td><td>One of last year's participants, Kensho Tambara, mentioned the program to me during kendo and I was interested in it the moment he described it to me. For many years, I served as a peer tutor and from that experience did I realize that I absolutely love teaching and seeing as how GAKKO endorses unconventional and dynamic ways of teaching, I thought this was so appropriate for me because I believe that the greatest gift you can give to someone is knowledge that they can hold onto for a lifetime and share with the rest of the world. GAKKO seemed great in that not only does it take my definition literally it implements it in a way that I honestly believe in and hope to be a part of!

  Kensho also described GAKKO to me as having a big art/design aspect to the program. As a visual artist, GAKKO was appealing to me because of the creative and fun way it is conducted. Art is something that cannot simply be taught; it must be developed and fostered in an environment that is rich in its appreciation. Creativity drives innovation and improvement. It is the foundation on which future success builds upon and to lack it is to lack the means to improve oneself and society. After all, how can we go forward if we’re reluctant to change our old ways? For that, I strongly appreciate GAKKO’s dedication to thinking outside of the box, especially with education.

  I'm also very much a fan of Japanese culture, and am currently taking a beginner’s Japanese language course this year with the hope that I will someday become fluent enough to carry a conversation and possibly use it to teach! Japan is a beautiful country with a just as amazing culture. I’ve never been overseas before and to finally do so in a meaningful way would be a dream come true.</td><td>In 10 years, I hope to be fluent in four languages: English, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Japanese. With these, I hope to someday become an English teacher, quite possibly in another country (maybe Japan)! I absolutely love learning and experiencing different cultures as well as sharing my own. That’s why I love languages so much, you can never really become an expert, only more fluent. I hope to travel often and just enjoying life! But some of my more personal goals are to become better in kendo and archery so I can truly complete my medieval fighting skills!</td><td>It's a Small World After All</td><td>Get out of those desks. Stand up a bit. Stretch. Look around. Those chairs you just sat in are little countries and you alone make up the population. Each of you carries a bit of your own unique culture and history, but so do the rest of the students in the room – the world’s population. Get rid of those desks, your borders and what do you have then? You and the rest of the world.

  In my class, I’d like to expand upon this idea of diversity and learning in what may seem like a large, impersonal place, but, in reality, is a small world full of infinite discoveries. I strongly feel that the best way to learn is not just from a book or even from a knowledgeable teacher alone, but from each other. Opening your mind up to different perspectives gives you the understanding you need to then learn and experience new things. That’s what makes you grow.

  I’d like to create a classroom in which there are no boundaries. I’d like to create one that utilizes shared space to encourage interaction in class - one that requires you to move around instead of sitting down in one place, one that makes you actively aware of the space that separates you and the rest of the world. Think of it like an open art studio with no chairs, only a few tables. Without the comforts of your desks, your defined borders, you’re suddenly more sensitive to the presence of others and in turn, your thoughts and feelings become all the more amplified and meaningful.

  By throwing away conventional borders can we open ourselves and our world up to others’. I want the class to be a space in which we can discuss and conduct our ideas and thoughts without feeling above or below. This is where art comes in. As I have said before, art is not something that can simply be taught. It needs to connect. With this class, I hope to create an atmosphere of greater appreciation for the rest of the world, no matter the scale: a planet, a continent, a country, a classroom, a person. We will draw from others’ experiences (both literally and figuratively) and create a collaborative work of art that reflects upon the world around them. More specifically, I want the class to be able to be to draw upon instances in their own life where the ideas of borders and boundaries didn’t work and create something meaningful and beautiful from it.

  It’s a small world after all so we need to be able to embrace it rather than isolate ourselves from it. Education is more than sitting in chairs and desks all day; it’s about finding the infinite discoveries around you.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Anna-Sophie Harling<br/>Yale University<br/>Freshman <br/>anna-sophie.harling@yale.edu</td><td>I first met Kenta, Florian, and Karl during my Bulldog Days visit this past April, and it was during that time that I first heard about GAKKO. I remember thinking back then that the premise behind the trip was fascinating and that I would try to become involved as soon as possible. Due to my somewhat obsessive perusal of the GAKKO blog this summer, my determination to do so has only strengthened over the past six months. I spent that summer in Beijing and was continually struck by how much richer the GAKKO experience seemed in comparison to mine. I was also impressed by the program's ability to bring together so many different interests and passions--photography, design, writing, communication, and business, to name a few. Although I definitely don't possess an outstanding skill in any of these fields, what makes GAKKO so appealing to me is the teaching aspect. GAKKO seems like a collection of interactive TED Talks that gives Japanese teenagers the opportunity to express themselves creatively and think freely, and I simply love this concept. I had the opportunity to teach math, English, and German to kids of different ages and nationalities throughout high school. In doing so, I realized that I truly love teaching, regardless of the subject.</td><td>I see myself living in Berlin, part-time architect, part-time owner of a jazz bar. Actually, I'm not entirely sure where I want to live, nor am I certain about what I want to be doing. Perhaps become a photojournalist, in which case I would be traveling quite a bit. I know that I would become extremely restless simply sitting at a desk year in and year out, and extremely unsatisfied in business. I would definitely be happy pursuing education in the future, although I don't think that I want it to become my primary occupation. I was struck by the fact that the adults involved in GAKKO are not teachers, but individuals who enjoy passing on their knowledge to others. I intend to do something similar--pursue a passion and then find a way to spread it.</td><td>The Sustainability Question</td><td>I'm not entirely sure how GAKKO addressed the concept of environmental sustainability this past summer, but I think that it is an issue that cannot be left out of the curriculum. GAKKO does such a great job of inspiring creativity and exploration in design and the arts; it seems only logical that we would want the students to go forth with a firm understanding of the environmental crisis as well. As they enter the world and decide to become architects, engineers, and politicians, they should do so with the sustainability question in the backs--or perhaps forefronts--of their minds. 
  The first part of the class would attempt to impress the urgency and importance of the issue upon the GAKKO students, depending on how Japanese schools typically teach environmental sustainability. Students would research environmental policies, examining how they differ from country to country. The majority of the course, however, would focus on solutions to various issues, approaching them from different perspectives--perhaps through topics taught in other GAKKO classes. For example, how is sustainability considered in fields such as architecture and design? How can photography spread awareness of environmental problems? What can businesses do to be more environmentally conscious? What about day-to-day solutions? How can GAKKO make a difference?
  Even if it is not its own, full class, I really do think that GAKKO should try and incorporate the sustainability question into its curriculum. Sustainability is all about approaching issues from different angles. Progress is made when people from different backgrounds and with different passions come together to find solutions. These are, I believe, the ideas that originally brought about the concept of GAKKO. GAKKO is all about creating a better learning environment, so why not learn about the environment?

  <tr><td>Schuyler Arakawa<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>schuyler.arakawa@yale.edu</td><td>I believe education is the single most important thing in the world to get any closer to creating a unified society. Yet, education and schooling have become so stagnate and worn out. I love that Gakko is taking such a colossal thing and completely revolutionizing it, with ideas that are so simple: the interactive approach, the studies that prove that people retain enjoyable experiences over negative ones. If learning can be enjoyable, why is not always?   
  Too often student’s creativity is stifled by the suffocating regulations placed in schools that they don’t allow time to question their boundaries.  Instead of putting up walls to restrict students, we need to foster the creativity and imaginations that are born into them. Students need to embrace the lack of inhibitions they had when creating and discovering as kids. These habits are born into us and have solely been stifled by the conventional form of teaching: of listening to a teacher speak at you, instead of conversing with you, of calling on a student to answer a question, instead of to ask one. I believe that Gakko can make a huge difference on such a vital part of life. 
  In addition, the meshing with a summer camp model fascinates me. There are things, unexplainable that I learned at summer camp. Something about that experience creates a bond that no one can justify, but everyone who’s felt it can understand. I’m so curious about what sparks that connection. I feel that Gakko is tapping into that hidden sensation and I want to take part. </td><td>In ten years, I’ll be 29 years old. Ideally I’ll have met someone to begin my life with, emphasize on the “begin.” There is still so much to see in ten years that I know I won’t even have touched on all that I want to explore. I’m extremely interested in social enterprise, the concept of using business models for social good, and started Yale’s first outlet for social enterprise at Yale called Net Impact. Ideally, my passions for social enterprise combined with my love for travelling would be sending me around the world, possibly consulting for different non-profits. Preferably, getting to travel to all of the different project sites, and seeing how much impact business models can have on the social sector. </td><td>How to Question the Dream</td><td>Go into an exam, any exam in the world and I guarantee you they all have one thing in common: questions. This sounds ridiculous. What would an exam be without questions to ask? Yet rarely in life will we be asked specific questions to which we find the answer. Instead, it will be us who needs to find the problems, to take everything and see what’s missing. Life is the exam without questions. 
  In real life, we must first identify the problem to have any chance at discovering the solution. This methodology dates back to Socrates, who knew that the best way to understand is to question. So why is there so much emphasis on how to find the right answer when we should instead be teaching how to ask the right question. 
  In one class I would make students outline their typical day in ten steps. I would then make them: 1. Find the thing that annoys them most about each step and find a solution. 2. Find a way to do each task upside down, backwards, or reversed. Sometimes the things we take as natural, would actually work better upside down. For example, people almost always put their cream in their coffee at the end, needing to constantly taste, dump out coffee, and add more milk. However, if we put the milk in first, and the coffee second, we would completely eliminate the need to dump and re-taste because we would be basing the amount of coffee we pour off of how much milk we have, which is much easier to estimate. Simple solutions can be found through reversals. 3. I would make them trade with a partner and question each other’s actions, the order, purpose, and efficiency; to try and discover problems that they might not have realized were there. 
  This is a very basic outline of how to teach students to question everything. Students need to re-learn how to learn. In this generation of technology, the youth are so quick to blindly accept everything as fact. What happened to the childish habit of questioning everything around us? Curiosity and the desire to explore are inherent within us. 
  Dreams are the perfect example of this. While sleeping, we physically manifest things that we’re lacking while we’re awake. Our dreams transform our everyday world into an unfamiliar labyrinth with vaguely familiar emotions. Subconsciously, our minds are capable of turning our entire worlds upside down. This is because in dreams, possibilities are endless.  We transform everything we accept as normal during the day. We ask: “Why not?” of everything.
  It’s this concept of questioning that creates the dreamers of the world. If we questioned everything, we could turn those unlimited dreams we have when we’re asleep into dreamers who are awake. By questioning, we can have a consciously inspired action for our life to be as limitless as our dreams make it. I would teach students how to question everything in their lives and, in return, how to dream. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Kathryn Osborn<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>kathryn.osborn@yale.edu</td><td>Simply put, my interest in GAKKO hinges on its motto: question learning.

  I attended high school in an international school in Bonn, Germany, following the IB curriculum.  While the 2-year IB Diploma program in itself is already an intensive and meticulously standardized program, within the hands of my school’s largely traditional British-educated administration and faculty, it was a monster.  11th and 12th grade were one long stressed-out hoop-jumping spectacle, in which the most valuable intellectual experiences were considered to be those that could expectedly translate to higher IB scores on our final exams.  And while it wouldn’t be fair to say that my teachers didn’t value creativity, unconventional wit, or challenges to the curriculum, these things were predominantly regarded as distractions within a classroom context.

  It was a system that inevitably frustrated me.  As part of my final Visual Arts exhibition, I created an installation of an antique desk chair surrounded by books that I had altered through some medium or another — paint, wax, collage, excavation, illustration, shredding, sculpture, stabbing with old scissors, etc.   The chair was placed amid suspended paper airplanes made from book pages and in front of a classroom blackboard on which I had written over and over in chalk (like a student being reprimanded), “I will not destroy books.”

  In retrospect, I realize that while this installation was a genuine act of expression, it was a superficial and unsuccessful way to rebel and regain control of my learning experience.  I came to Yale still stuck in a hoop-jumping mindset — only here, I was so preoccupied with the possibility of failure that for a long time I more or less failed to engage and take intellectual or extracurricular risks altogether.  I had forgotten how to question or challenge, and as a result I was standing still, getting more and more entrenched in old versions of myself.    

  I know very little about Japan, or the extent to which my tumultuous relationship with learning resembles varied individual experiences within the Japanese education system.  What I do know, however, is that I’m currently at a place in my education where nothing is going unquestioned, and I’ve never been more excited.   GAKKO seems like exactly the type of fire I’d like to fuel, and I have no doubt it’s something that could be transformative for my own intellectual journey as well.
  </td><td>Ideally, I’m consistently on the move.  I hope I’m creating, and I hope I’m surprising myself. </td><td>[Dé]collaging Ideas and Narratives</td><td>Alteration through mixed media collage, décollage, assemblage, and any other variation or combination of these (for simplicity, I’ll henceforth call the all-encompassing process of altering through either adding, removing or assembling “[dé]collage”) has long been an interest and hobby of mine.  I love the way that [dé]collage allows the simultaneously visceral and intentioned repurposing of images, words, objects and materials that have become stale, generic or overlooked.  More importantly, I love the way that such repurposing expands vocabularies and forges fresh mental connections that routinized language and trained consciousness often block. 
  Art provides the point of entry for this class.  We will not be evaluating art itself, however, so much as the usefulness of acts of repurposing and alteration.  I will begin with a visual presentation of intentioned art that involves mixed media [dé]collage, drawing specific attention to titles, artists’ statements, and recurring motifs as indicators of thought processes.  Ideally, prep for this presentation would also include reaching out to the artists themselves (when possible) to collect primary information.  Tom Phillips’ A Humument would be one possible jumping off point for the presentation.  It’s an altered book in which Phillips collaged, painted, and drew over W.H. Mallock’s 1892 novel The Human Document, selectively maintaining pieces of text, to forge not only a piece of art but also an entirely new story  — new protagonist, new plot and all.  By viewing his pages before and after, we can examine how alterations both make use of and redirect existing meaning. 
  This class, however, is less about appreciating [dé]collage as an art form and more about using it as a point of entry into fresher, riskier ways of expressing ideas and narratives in thought and speech.  Too often, our thought patterns are limited by prescribed vocabularies, points of entry, and assumptions.  
  	The presentation will be followed by an exercise set around a table covered with hundreds of pieces of collage materials, mainly cutout images and largely printed bits of text.  The class as a whole will be presented with some sort of stimulus to inspire discussion or debate.  The discussion, however, must take the form of a collage, where students have to select materials from the table in front of them and creatively use those materials as core elements of their speech.  Essentially, they'll be "speaking collage."
  	Throughout this process of collaging, my job will be to “décollage” by throwing caveats into the discussion that undermine basic societal assumptions.  Say the stimulus to the discussion is an article about the ethics of reproduction.  How does the discussion shift if suddenly we imagine a society in which the family unit no longer exists — where the government takes possession of children from birth?  
  While this whole thing is highly experimental, the basic idea is to create a low-stakes, highly imaginative form of creative play.  If done well and in an environment of trust, it should encourage risk-taking that turns out new and fresh ways of envisioning and presenting things.

Finally they also all had an amazing time while they were there.</td><td>I hope to either be working on juvenile prison education reform or development economics in emerging democracies.  </td><td>How to laugh at yourself</td><td>How to Laugh at Yourself

  We often magnify small, daily mistakes because of their embarrassing nature. But by seeing the humor in what could be an anxiety producing accident, you can prevent the stress that goes with re-playing a stupid decision or klutzy fall over and over in your head. And learning to laugh at yourself can also make you more comfortable with trying new things in your life. The world of higher education is filled with people that take themselves very seriously, and that tends to rub off on the best of us. We can take what we do and our relationships earnestly, but if we take ourselves too seriously, we can end up preventing ourselves from having new experiences. If we are afraid to make a mistake because of how others look at us or because of the pressure we give ourselves to always be perfect, the potentially embarrassing consequences will prevent us from taking chances to try something different.  Learning to laugh at ourselves when we mess up makes our mistakes seem much less important, making us more willing to try something new. Whether you trip over your own feet, try and fail at a new dance move, or make some embarrassing mistakes when reaching out of your comfort zone, laughing at yourself can have a positive impact on you, and those around you. Your own life can be less stressful and happier, and you will appear more approachable, leading those around you to also be more comfortable.
   
  The goal of this class would be to help the students become more comfortable with laughing at themselves, which I believe will led them to be more comfortable with themselves in general. I would hope to start the class off with icebreakers; in particular those that include doing bizarre movements, or games that involve actions that look very strange.  The icebreakers used during FOOT would serve as good examples. The idea behind this would be to have the students try out (on a small scale) things that can be embarrassing, and using the tool of laughing at yourself to make them more comfortable. Then I would like to explain the reasons that laughing at yourself can be beneficial, and start into a discussion with the students about how it can be a tool to make one more comfortable in embarrassing situations. I hope to continue by having the students attempt a skill that they want to try, but that can have embarrassing results, such as bizarre yoga positions, or juggling. From there I would end with a discussion about how laughing at yourself can make you more comfortable with the idea of making a mistake, and eventually trying new things on a larger scale.

The opportunity to teach chess is always something I greatly enjoy. I have traveled around the world playing chess, but never have been fully able to immerse myself in the culture of the country. When I was in Shanghai, I spent a day with the Shanghai Chess Club and found it very rewarding. I have taught many chess camps around the United States, and there is nothing quite like the feeling you get when you realize you have just successfully given knowledge to another human being. I understand that Japan has Shogi, but there is no reason for the large gap in chess-playing strength. Japan is currently ranked 98th in the world, a ranking far lower than would one would expect. Beyond what I can give to Japan, I am interested as well in what Japan can offer me- a cultural experience that is impossible to replicate. Over the years I have learned a bit about Japanese society, but only so much can truly be understood through words on a page or characters on a screen. The chance to explore such a fantastic country would be invaluable.</td><td>I'm going to be a father of two with a wife I love dearly. I will live in New York City, likely working in the sports industry. I intend on making the sports site (http://thesportsquotient.com/) I am VP of a huge success. This will allow me to contribute to the world in a field I am truly invested in and love. Sports at their best are a unifying activity - cities come together when their team is performing well. Chuck Pagano, the Indianapolis Colts' head coach has Leukemia and the amount of support that has poured in in the state of Indiana has been simply astonishing. I see myself being a part of the sports world in a way that hopefully transcends sports themselves: providing fans with a unique spin on the games we know and love while simultaneously keeping even non-sports watchers engaged. To me, there would be nothing better for a profession. </td><td>Mastering the Mysteries of Chess</td><td>Mastering the Mysteries of Chess would provide much more than a simple chess lesson. Chess will be a vehicle that opens students' minds to complex ideas that transcend the 8 by 8, 64 square board. Using examples drawn from chess games and my own teaching experience, lessons in pattern recognition, memory, strategy can be created and taught. Seemingly a game of logic and foresight, chess can also be entirely unpredictable. Some structured teachings methods for this class would include tactical exercises (a simple example would be one where you give white the move and ask the player to fork the opposing player's king and queen with his knight) and "endgame exercises" (teaching basic theoretical positions first, and then exploring more difficult situations when the students grasp the basics). Additionally, activities like group games are particularly beneficial. Although chess is indeed an individual game, much is learned by playing as a team against another. After all, when individuals with different or conflicting ideas interact they learn from one another. This class would be well-suited for players of all strengths, from beginner to expert. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Taryn Laubenstein<br/>Yale University<br/>Junior<br/>taryn.laubenstein@yale.edu</td><td>I attended the GAKKO information session at Yale and was very interested, and inspired.  I had seen pictures from a mutual friend involved in the program, but didn’t know what it was all about.  After the meeting, I really understood what a commitment this program is— but also how enriching and rewarding it can be.  I have taught in the past and even developed my own lesson plan, but this camp is much beyond the scope of anything I’ve done before.  Still, I think I’m up to the challenge.</td><td>In ten years, I would like to be involved in protecting the environment.  I’m not sure exactly what my role will be— researcher?  Environmental lawyer?  Professor?  But I do plan to go to graduate school for Biological Oceanography to study the marine ecosystem, and how climate change has affected it.  I believe that climate change is the single largest problem that we face as a global society, and I want to do everything I can to help protect our planet.  </td><td>Sustainability: It’s Easy Being Green</td><td>	Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword— it’s a whole new way of thinking that will impact everything from business to technology to school in the future.  But I feel that students today don’t get to learn what sustainability means, and how it affects them.  And personally, as an Ecology and Evolutionary Biology major with a strong investment in protecting the environment, I know that in high school I did not get to spend enough time out in the field, exploring the very environment that I so dearly wished to protect.
  	My class would hinge on these two ideas: sustainability and the environment.  We would start in the classroom, and warm up by trying to answer the questions “What is sustainability?   How does one live sustainably?”  We would get a whole list of answers on the board and try to categorize them; is an individual doing this?  A big business? A country?  
  	After we define sustainability in all its complexity, we’ll move on to talking about the environment.  The youth of today are going to inherit an Earth with a staggering amount of environmental problems.  I would ask the students to give examples— climate change, pollution, endangered species, overpopulation, waste of resources.  But one of the most important parts of teaching about the environment is to avoid a doom-and-gloom approach to the problem.  So, for each environmental problem we discuss, I’ll provide an example in which that problem was mitigated or overcome.  For instance, when we talk about pollution, I will give the example of the Montreal Protocol.  In the past, overuse of chemicals called CFCs was depleting the ozone layer and contributing to global warming— but after 20 nations signed the Montreal Protocol, CFCs were effectively banned, and the ozone layer is expected to recover by 2050.  
  	After we talk about past problems, I would break the students into groups, and give each an environmental problem to solve.  The twist is, there are often multiple solutions for each environmental issue— so I would challenge them to think of as many solutions as possible.  This will get the students to think creatively and broadly about how to solve problems at different levels: individuals, business, nations.  We’d then come back together and present the ideas.  
  	Finally, I would like to incorporate the environment into the lesson.  To get the students to understand their environment better and put their theory to the test, I would have them go outside (perhaps to a beach, as I know Shodoshima is an island) and clean up the area.  Then, with the plastic and debris they collected, I would challenge them to create a collage or sculpture out of their trash.  These images could be displayed in their home schools to raise awareness of littering and pollution.  But again, the stress is not on the negative of pollution, but the positive of cleaning up, and being inspired by art and nature.  From this class, the students would not only learn about sustainability, but also embody it.

  <tr><td>Henry <br/>Wolf<br/>Freshman <br/>henry.wolf@yale.edu</td><td>My interest in the idea of education followed from skepticism about my own high school experience. The high school I attended, St. Paul’s School, is a traditional boarding school located in the woods of New Hampshire. There, we learned, yet were rarely taught about learning. As my closest friends and I began retrospectively discussing our boarding school experience, we realized how little we knew about the rationale behind our education. Ever since, I’ve been fascinated by the ideology behind the various educational institutions. When I heard about Gakko from Nathanial Toppelberg, I saw it as an experiential way to develop my understanding of the educational institution through the process of creating one. The testimonies I’ve heard have excited me more about this experimental, creative, and hands-on approach to learning about learning. </td><td>Since I haven’t even chosen my major, I find it hard to discern what I’ll be doing ten years from now. However, consideration of my strengths, weaknesses, and interests allows me a basic understanding of how I’ll be living my life. I’m generally interested how humans impose order on their reality and how to alter this structure for the better. Throughout the next three years here, I’ll hopefully investigate this wide-ranging question from a psychological, philosophical, sociological, and artistic perspective. I hope to find myself working in an environment that is intimate enough for me to see the effect of my actions, yet slow enough for me to frequently stop and contemplate. </td><td>Responsibility and the Secondary School</td><td>          The secondary school is a microcosm; just as within a society, the educational environment is comprised of individuals that assume roles. While societal roles are not formed in the name of one collective purpose, the form of the roles in a secondary school follows the function of the institution: to facilitate the students’ development. Educators prepare the students for the continuous task of being responsible for themselves by designating responsibilities to the students and holding them accountable. As the student does what is expected of them, they are bestowed more of the responsibility of defining the boundaries of their control. The institution has successfully fulfilled its responsibility for the students when they can determine what responsibility is for their selves. 
           In order to act outside the authority of educators, a student must assume the responsibility for determining their own responsibility. Therefore, they must understand why this task is important and how to approach it. On an academic and professional level, I believe that the answer lies in an understanding of one’s propensities and suitable tasks that build of strengths and improve weaknesses. Since we are never free from responsibility—even when no one is holding us accountable—the word “responsibility” has a negative connotation. For the same reason, students would benefit from an introduction to this existential concept within the application of their own secondary schooling. I do not believe responsibility is inherently either good or bad, but I’ve seen it framed as both. I’ve competed for certain responsibilities that I considered worthwhile, like this one. At the same time, I’ve found myself frustrated with responsibilities that I cannot handle, for many reasons. Having escaped from various responsibilities, I realized the privilege that is having someone telling you what to do the summer after I graduated from high school. This class would not only be meaningful for me to teach because it has the potential to share a methodology for answering the type of questions I found myself asking near the end of high school—but the sort of questions I think we confront as humans on a daily basis.

  <tr><td>Ezra Ritchin<br/>Yale<br/>Sophomore<br/>ezra.ritchin@yale.edu</td><td>Many internships and summer jobs seem to entail doing busy work and serving as a sort of interchangeable part—an Excel spreadsheet will look the same regardless of who is inputting the data. Each classroom, on the other hand, is unique to a teacher and his/her students.  This opportunity to expose students to new sides of themselves, and to learn from them in the process, is far more appealing to me than the chance to work as an intern or research assistant.

  A passion for teaching runs in my blood. My mom taught at the International Center for Photography, my dad is a professor at NYU, and my older brother works at Columbia. I hope to follow this family lead, and I am currently a tutor with the Urban Improvement Corps, where I give math and reading help to a fifth grader named Kevin. I am also currently enrolled in a program called Community Based Learning, where I survey local residents and do research to help Artspace decide how best to use the vacant lot on Chapel between Church and Orange. 

  I opted to join CBL rather than take the final exam in my New Haven and the American City class because I was tired of scrambling to record and recite every fact that had been thrown at me. A good education is more than a simple transfer of information; it pushes students to rethink their worldview, to re-evaluate their goals and purposes, to “Question Learning.” It is the faithfulness to this tagline that draws me so strongly to Gakko.</td><td>I don’t know where I’ll be working in ten years, but I know in what type of environment I want to be working. In a decade, I would like to find myself in a community surrounded by people who are united by a common goal—people who will challenge me intellectually, much as they do here at Yale, to find a way to most effectively reach this shared goal. </td><td>Personal Narrative</td><td>Kevin slowly reaches down to pick up another paper clip. He dropped it on purpose, of course, just as he did the rest of them. He finds clever ways to waste time—going to the bathroom, asking me to name my favorite dessert, or fumbling with paper clips—when it’s time to move on to his English homework.

  Kevin is the fifth grader I tutor through the Urban Improvement Corps, and he does not like reading or writing. He spends his spare time playing Call of Duty or even doing extra multiplication problems with his uncle, but he can’t name his favorite author or recall the last book he read for fun. The only time I’ve seen his eyes light up for an English assignment the way they do when we review exponents or long division was when he came in with the homework prompt: “Write about a time when you felt proud.” He recalled the story of winning a relay race in the third grade (he later informed me that he is, in fact, a distant relative of Usain Bolt), and he completed the assignment without taking a bathroom break or fiddling with paper clips.

  Personal narrative has the power to bring out the most passionate and capable writer within us. When I was younger, my parents suggested I start a journal, and it was this daily narrative that pushed me towards writing and helped me get to know myself better. A class on personal narrative could be invaluable for the students in Gakko as they move through the college application process and beyond, especially in light of the standardized-test based nature of Japanese high schools. 

  If students are constantly being tested, their educational focus shifts away from their own goals and ideas and towards the information that they must be able to memorize and reproduce. This constant focus on the exterior—factoids and lessons that do not necessarily touch the students on an individual level—leaves little room for discussion, doubt, and self-reflection. A prompt as simple as, “Write about a time when you felt proud” could bring out a side of the students that had been left unexposed through constant memorization and testing. They could then share their narratives with the other students in the class, and in doing so help develop the fundamental liberal arts capacity for self-appreciation and expression.

  By looking into their past for important memories and moments, these students are doing more than simply fostering an enthusiasm and skill for writing—they are learning about what is important to them. It is this capability for meaningful introspection that I would hope my students would take from the class.</td></tr>

I play varsity ice hockey at Yale, and am passionate about international development.  I am working to start a high performance training camp in Japan with players from Canada and the United States, where women from the Japanese national team can train so that Team Japan can become more competitive on the world stage.  I am also going to do research on my senior thesis that will involve the economic consequences of the tsunami.  Thus, when I mentioned my summer plans to a friend, she told me about GAKKO.  I looked up the program and GAKKO’s mission struck a chord with me.  While I am very thankful to be blessed with the education I enjoy, I do believe that conventional education is lacking in a plethora of ways.  I want education to shape and grow student creativity, rather than stifle it.  I also believe that education should help a person develop their interests and enrich their personality, and thus there should be classes that reflect these goals.  I want to become a part of the GAKKO team, to both help develop its mission and possibly expand the program.  I am half Japanese (half Canadian,) so I am excited about the possibility of returning to Japan and by the opportunity to connect with Japanese students.  As I am going to be in Japan before the program starts, perhaps I could help with development efforts and initiatives to publicize GAKKO’s mission in Japan.    
  </td><td>I really like to invent things.  In my spare time, I think of silly gimmicks that I want to create.

Most of all, I HOPE I'M HAPPY.   </td><td>Express Yourself</td><td>Cat’s got your tongue? Don't quite know what to say? Do you ever have an amazing idea, but when you try to explain it to somebody, it comes out all wrong and jumbled?  In my class, I want to teach students how to effectively and succinctly communicate their ideas and thoughts to each other, as well as how to respond intelligently on their feet.  I envision this class having 3 components: word association, improvisation and speech delivery.  Personally, when trying to tell a story I often find myself reaching for that "perfect" word to describe something.  In order to help with this incidence, I plan on playing a word association game that will help students with spontaneously forming synonyms and thinking of descriptive words.  I will show students a picture of a scene or an object, and they will then describe the picture using as many adjectives as they can.  This will force students to expand their thinking and vocabulary past where they are comfortable.  They will learn new words and synonyms, which they can incorporate into their thinking.  Next, I would like to play an improvisation game (commonly played in high school drama and theatre classes.)  I will give a group of students a setting and characters, and they will have to act out a story and then I will rapidly change the scene.  This will help students learn to think quickly on their feet.  The final component of the class will integrate all of the skills that the beginning of the class has endeavored to teach.  Students will be asked to prepare a 2 minute speech about an idea that they are passionate about, and students will be asked to present the speech in front of the class.  This will help students develop their ideas with clarity.  The end goal of my class is for students to feel more confident and comfortable in expressing their own ideas and thoughts.  I hope to help alleviate some of the linguistic roadblocks that often occur when trying to express an idea.  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Noah Remnick<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>noahremnick@gmail.com</td><td>Participants in last summer's GAKKO impressed me with their extreme enthusiasm for teaching students using innovative, creative methods that bucked the traditional classroom in favor of experiential, participatory learning. Such unbridled passion is rare -- and deeply enticing because it tells me that not only did the program motivate the students, it clearly influenced the teachers, as well, who left buoyed by the exciting intellectual experiment.</td><td>Writing has always been a way for me to understand the world, to express my opinions, to reach out to other people, and to bring about political and social change. As I look at what I might be doing 10 years from now, I am still not settled on an exact career path. But I do know that anything I do must add measurable social good, and it must involve writing. One of the joys and privileges of being at a university as rich and diverse as Yale is that I am fortunate to have educational and extra curricular opportunities that open vistas I never expected to see. The most dramatic example of this for me thus far is that I went to work for the Obama campaign as an intern this summer, and ended up being hired on a campaign staffer. I thought I would be answering phones and performing other menial tasks for the cause; instead, as part of the digital outbound team, I spent the summer advancing Obama's re-election through my writing: interviewing and writing articles about supporters, tweeting, preparing reports on reaching different demographic groups, writing emails to supporters from the President among others. The work was incredibly rewarding, and it underscored for me the joy writing, how much good writing touches and motivates people, and how important it is to me to use my  writing to make a difference in the world, whether through fiction, journalism, politics, law, social action, or some combination I have yet to imagine.</td><td>Introduction to Storytelling</td><td>One of the ironies of life is that safety and comfort are often the enemies of rigorous thinking. The New York world that has been my home, a place that prides itself on diversity of background and opinion, is, like many other communities, often guilty of fooling itself, a herd of independent minds that rarely recognizes its own unanimity. Take the intractable Israeli-Arab conflict. This is a debate that, at least at the high school I attended and in the community in which I live, is met with a curious like-mindedness or, worse, a
  distant apathy.
  So, as I listened in horror one day to Roshan, a seemingly demure teenaged girl from Palestine, announce that she would one day die as a shaheeda, a martyr, for her country, I thought to myself: this is part of a true education.
  Roshan and I were taking part in a program called Seeds of Peace at a camp in Otisfield, Maine. Founded in 1993, Seeds of Peace brings together young people from the Middle East, South Asia, the United States, and other areas of the world riven by conflict. Kids engage in the normal activities of a summer camp, but for a couple of hours a day they take part in prolonged intense “dialogue sessions” to wear down stereotypes and create some sense of common ground.
  Roshan’s testimony that morning was startling. She had, it seemed, accepted her country’s narrative of dispossession and rebellion, but her view of armed uprising met a challenge when Yuval, an Israeli boy, told of his grief when three of his friends died at the hands of suicide bombers. Until that evening, Yuval had been a caricature of the Israeli right--his accusatory screams were the root of countless disputes about the history of the conflict--and yet his story brought tears to every one of us in the group and humanized the issue of martyrdom.
  I know that no summer program can be fully transformative, but I can see that Seeds of Peace opened a kind of door for my friends and me. It didn't revealed a dewy sense of idealism, nor did it teach us that Israelis and Palestinians don’t know each other--in some ways, they know each other all too well. But the experience did say something about knowledge itself, and the power of storytelling. After weeks of unproductive yelling matches that only left everyone even more firmly entrenched in their one-sided views on the conflict, it was only when we began telling our stories that we began to see fuller understanding and inklings of progress.The conflict may never come to an end in my lifetime, but when it does, I know that paramount in its resolution will be a sense of empathy. That's what I gained from Seeds of Peace and that's precisely what I hope to bring to GAKKO.
  The class I propose is one that would apply the lessons of Seeds of Peace to teach a class in narrative storytelling as means of bridging differences and resolving conflicts. Such a class would give students the skills of interviewing, expressing their opinions in a non-confrontational manner, and learning to really listen to the opinions of people on the other side of a political, economic, religious, or social divide. Such a class would be a more interactive way to study current events in the context of world history and with the further goal of encouraging dialogue to effect political and social change.</td></tr>

I want to be able to use my passion and personality to impact students on the other side of the globe. I hope that by participating in GAKKO, I can make the students remember who I am years after they leave, and hopefully that they will take a part of what they learned with them for the rest of their lives. Another aspect that I find unique about GAKKO is the collaboration that goes on with the other Sempai, for there is so much more we can learn and teach each other about education. </td><td>I spent the past year questioning myself as a pre-med student. After many years of research, and working in clinics, I have realized that perhaps what motivates me the most about my interest in medicine is not just a clinical diagnosis perspective, but rather the bigger issues of economics and how that plays a role in health outcomes and healthcare systems. I’ve decided that I want to make a broader impact on the healthcare world and would like to focus on bridging economics and medicine in my studies to create better healthcare. Therefore, while I no longer see the same solid plan of medical school and then residency in the immediate future, I’ve come to realize what motivates me more than anything. Even if it’s not defined by a set-in-stone pre-professional academic track, I believe I have found a passion to pursue for the rest of my life. Ten years from now, I hope that I will be working or studying in a progressive environment surrounded by the type of inspiring people that I go to school with now.</td><td>Open your eyes to science</td><td>
  My class will be a series of mini-lessons in three different fields of science. Students are not to use any paper, pens, computers, or any other devices throughout the class, as my goal is to teach the lessons and make them memorable so that note-taking isn’t necessary.
  One of the biggest problems with the way science is taught is that there is too much textbook reading and note-taking and not enough visual learning. While I understand this standardized approach to learning science, I believe that this is not an exciting way to learn. I hate seeing students lose interest in science because they think it’s boring, when they are really just being lost to the wrong approach to education. Science is stereotyped as a male-dominated, dry, non-creative field of academia. In a world where science and technology progresses so fast and is changing the way we live our lives faster than any other field, it’s our responsibility to steer the next generation the right direction. Innovative scientific discoveries are the past, the present, and the future, and there is no time to leave innovative discoveries up to the rare prodigies and experts.
  I find that visual learning is the best way to really understand a concept. The biggest downfall of relying too much on textbooks for learning science is that students regurgitate information and get away with it, because unlike humanities where one has to come up with their creative pieces, science is taught and thought of by students as rote memorization. The reason I have always loved science was not because I could memorize concepts and spit them back on a test well enough to score high marks, but rather for the “ah-hah!” moments that I had when I used different methods to truly understand the concepts I was studying. 
  Therefore, my goal is to help students engage with science in a new light. I would begin with a chemistry lesson, performing an iodide titration to measure the amount of vitamin c in fruits. This uses basic concepts of inorganic chemistry, but presenting it in an applicable format makes the experiment so much more understandable. The next lesson would be a biology experiment in which students would extract DNA from strawberries. I would end the day with an exercise in the cognitive science field of visual perception, exhibiting vision as an inverse problem and the concept of instinct blindness, and how this attributes to our understanding of the mind. This would involve a champagne wire cork illusion that has dumbfounded everyone I’ve shown it to. 
  I would begin each lesson by posing a multiple-choice question about the topic. The students would answer the question anonymously with clickers, and then discuss their answers among themselves. After, I would ask the question again to see how their answers changed after talking with their peers. I would then give an overview of the topic I would exhibit and present the relevant information that they need to know before beginning the demonstrations. Throughout the demonstrations, I would teach the scientific concept as I went, so that it is much more memorable and the students will feel their "ah-hah!" moment sometime during the lesson.

  To be fair, I am not a nerd who loves schools so much that I want to spend the rest of my life there. (Currently, I am dying to finish the last few days of this semester.) Rather, I am interested in education and in developing an educational system that centers around the students and their development.  Having gone through 12 years of school in Vietnam and still make it to where I am today, I admit that I am lucky failure of the Vietnamese educational system, where all I did was to memorize every single word written in the text books, take the exams, and forget everything I have learned. Throughout those 12 years, I often wished that there were more open discussion in the class, where the teachers' and textbooks' answers were not necessarily the only correct answers. I often longed for more presentations, more interactive learnings through hand-on experience, and less of memorization. I believe that true learning has to start from the interest and inspiration. A person learns best when he is fascinated about the topic and dying for more information. Learning happens not only at schools, but it can happens any time any where, as long as we want to learn. When I read about GAKKO, I know that must join you guys, for we are looking at one same direction.
  </td><td>In 10 years, I will have earned a Master Degree in Education, and a PhD in Public Policy (or a PhD in Educational Policy, which is perfect!) 
  To be honest, I do not know where I will be in 10 years yet, for I believe that a strong educational background is the first requirement of success. (Disclaimer: This need not be true to anyone.)

In my classroom, students are free to learn what they want when they want it, with proper instructions and guidance from the teachers. Students are free to experiment and play around with their thoughts, whether those thoughts will work or not, they will decide.

I went to Regis, a preparatory school in Manhattan that offers a tuition-free education to a wide diversity of young men. Although the people and the opportunities have certainly played a role in keeping Regis dear to my heart, I believe that structure of the education was the most important feature. In every corner of every floor there was a room called a “resource center.” Each department claimed one of these nooks, and all the teachers of a discipline set up shop in the same room. But the rooms were for the students. If I had a math test coming up, for example, I would walk right by the library and choose to study in the math resource center instead. There, I’d find every math teacher at his desk, available for any question I might have. Students often found themselves just having casual conversations with their teachers during entire free periods. The relationships that formed were dynamic; roles often switched and teachers always thanked their students for contributing to their own education This is the reason our school budget is funded entirely by the generosity of alumni.. What I’m getting at is simple. The most effective type of education is an education that involves dialogue. If teachers are willing to engage their students in conversation, the effects on learning are tremendous. I feel that through GAKKO, I’d have the chance to help spread this form of teaching. At the same time, just like my high school teachers, I feel that the students have a lot to teach me. Through our mutual success, we can help promote a new classroom ethos built around question learning.</td><td>Every now and then I have an epiphany: this is how I'm going to spend the rest of my life, that is how I want to make a living, this is where I want to raise a family. Nothing ever sticks for too long, but I feel like the pieces are finally coming together. This past summer, I visited Italy for the time. Both sides of my family came to America from Sicily, so I felt a particularly strong connection to the country. I never thought, however, that I'd come back any different. Instead, during my five weeks abroad, I decided that I want to work in international politics. The North-South divide in Italy is of particular interest. With my Southern Italian background, I was hurt to encounter prejudice and economic disparity between the two macro-regions. The social split dates back to before unification and reached a high during Fascism, but conditions still haven't changed much. The Southern people suffer from an underdeveloped economy and integrated corruption. Aid from external actors is limited, and public policy is doing nothing. So, in ten years, I hope to be in Italy researching these problems and trying to find a cure. That is, until I have my next life-changing revelation.</td><td>Applied Philosophy</td><td>As I mentioned above, I went to a Jesuit high school. The education was infused with an Ignatian spirit of reflection. In every class, no matter the subject, the whole person was the focus. The intent was to build knowledge, but also character. This would not be possible if retreats and other opportunities to reflect had not been built into the curriculum. Of course, in secular education this is less feasible. However, every class teaches theory, regardless of affiliation. We learn to deduce broad conclusions from passages in a text, numbers jumbled together in a formula, or cells under a microscope. The next step is learning how to apply what we learn to our own lives. Since not everything we learn is relevant for our day-to-day lives, it really comes down to learning how to ask the right questions.

  In my class, Applied Philosophy, I would teach an interdisciplinary syllabus. I’d include readings and exercises from wide-ranging areas of study. The agenda would involve deduction and application. Students would help me extract the thought process of the author in each text. We’d experiment with alternative steps and try to reach our own conclusions. Then, we’d take the conclusions as printed in the original text and discuss how to apply them in our own lives. For example, take Aristotle’s theory of happiness. In simplest terms, he believes that the secret to life is habit. I’d ask my students how they would develop healthy habits in their own life and how they might stick to them. The structure would be somewhat formulaic but no one discussion would be the same. My hope would be to incorporate reflection into the daily routine of my students. I feel that one cannot go through life without regularly stopping to look back and learn or to closely examine and reexamine what’s at hand. Reflection is difficult to sustain, however, if you don’t know what questions to ask. I’d encourage my students to proceed through discussions with a chain of questions. These questions should be constructive, but at the same time deductive. The end product would not be important for the success of the class. After all, each student will make his own conclusions. The key is the process. Students will learn when to ask and how to ask.

  Developing these habits during high school is extremely important. The choices these students face will face in the next few years of their life will determine where they end up for college, what they study, and how they find happiness. Thus, I think it would be worthwhile to learn how to question everything in Applied Philosophy. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Dipika Gawande<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>dipika.gawande@yale.edu</td><td>I am very inspired by the beautiful simplicity of GAKKO's goal. As a student of the Montessori method of primary education, I am motivated by the idea that inspiration for big ideas can be promoted in the same simple fashion that a kindergarten class fosters love and excitement of learning. This excitement, unfortunately, fades with academic progression. It is imperative to stop this loss. 
  I am also very interested in the fact that this project may be pursued in India in the next few years; I am intimately familiar with the problems in the Indian education system, even at the top tiers. The system's current construction – the testing methods, teaching methods, thinking methods – very dangerously curbs the brightest minds, and as such, the students who are most equipped with the smarts to change the world are not motivated to do so -- or worse, are not even aware that thinking outside the box is a possibility, let alone a necessity. It is imperative that we remove this handicap from the students who have the ability to change the world. </td><td>In 10 years, I will have finished medical school and my residency, and want to work in rural India or Africa. I want to see 300 patients a day so I can understand the complexity of tropical diseases, and solve them holistically. Western medicine does not understand the whole human interaction involved in solving disease; as yet, western medicine employs solutions that are localized to immediately affected areas, rather than based in a global understanding of the global body as a whole.</td><td>Chemistry as Social Networks</td><td>I am a ‘science person.’ Specifically, I am a chemistry person. I practice and pursue the study of it, and do so well because I adore it. Sitting in a chemistry class – or any class – convinced that it’s not your thing because you cannot possibly see how to love it is excruciating. I wish to inspire the uninspired to look at chemistry in the way that I do.  It is simple.

  Albert Camus wrote once that all thought is anthropomorphic: “The mind’s deepest desire, even in its most elaborate operations...parallels man’s unconscious feeling in the face of his universe: it is an insistence upon familiarity …Understanding the world for a man is reducing it to the human, stamping it with his seal.” Man is obsessed with the human, with himself, his relationship to other humans, and their relationships to each other and him. Chemistry is nothing more or less than the study of relationships. In fact, this phenomenon is explanatory of all fields that humans find fascinating. The very basis of social science, economics, history, philosophy, and political science is relationships. Language exists for the sake of relationships. To understand art is to make connections from the art to the human. Even math's quest is to make relationships concrete. This innate interest in interactions is hardwired into us.(If Albert Camus does not convince you of this, Mark Zuckerberg surely must!) 

  I love chemistry because I see the world of chemistry alive in a very human sense, in that the components of the subject material have human characteristics. And I am – as are you, even if you don’t know it – obsessed with interactions that result from human characteristics. 

  The first step, therefore, is to introduce the idea of anthropomorphization into the chemistry classroom. The uninspired student of high school chemistry sits in class and receives numb, inanimate, information about water and its properties as a polar molecule; H2O exhibits hydrogen bonding; this causes its numerous peculiar qualities and merits it an entire chapter to itself in the high school chemistry curriculum. Why is the concept of hydrogen bonding – such a beautifully simple, humanly intuitive concept – so difficult for human students to care about and therefore understand?  The exercise is to see the human-ness: in water, hydrogen is bonded to oxygen. Fat oxygen is greedy and self-absorbed; he doesn’t care about light, pretty (blonde, perhaps?) hydrogen’s needs and hogs to himself the majority of the electrons they’re supposed to share. As a result, hydrogen naturally feels neglected. She then acts in accordance with the way any woman trapped in this type of relationship would act: she makes eyes at other men. Water, then, is rife with these sorts of flirty-eye interactions caused by the neglected hydrogens eyeing the egoistic oxygens of other relationships, and of these oxygens ignoring their own wives and eyeing others’. This very human behavior is intuitive. It is effortless for any person to understand: a woman with specific personality traits placed in a certain situation will tend toward a set of understandable behaviors; so too for a man.

  This exercise may appear sophomoric and rudimentary, but it isn’t. Its simplicity generalizes. 
  	The Farrelly brothers’ 2001 live action/animated film Osmosis Jones performs this exercise stellarly (this sort of thinking frame would benefit from clips of the film) by anthropomorphizing the inside of the human body into a city (What is a city, but a network of relationships?). 
  	Synthetic chemist Scott J. Miller of Yale University wrote his dissertation on the Stetter reaction, a complex reaction involving many steps towards understanding enzyme catalysis. However, second-year college students of organic chemistry can work out the sequence because it is based on about 20 very simple, predictable behaviors of various atoms in a given set of relationships and conditions. In the same way a human can follow and understand the plot of a movie because he emotes with the understandable behavioral tendencies of the characters, I can follow Miller’s award-winning Stetter reaction because I can predict how a carbon atom who feels neglected will tend to behave in a given situation.

  <tr><td>Seth Thompson<br/>Yale University<br/>Junior<br/>seth.thompson@yale.edu</td><td>From the first day Kenta told me about Gakko, I was hooked.
  Changing the way education works is a personal passion of mine.  My favorite teacher out of all my years of schooling was my middle school math teacher.  He was the most outrageous, irreverent person you could imagine.  He swore everyday and made jokes constantly.  But he knew how to teach.  He was such a good teacher, in fact, that I still consider him to be the biggest influence on my decision to major in math in college!

  Inspired by my math teacher, I have been interested in education reform ever since.  I have tutored math (elementary school math to advanced calculus) and science (physics, chemistry, and computer science) on and off for the past 9 years.  In fact, when my calculus teacher was absent one day in high school, the class had me teach the lesson instead!  Each year that I tutor, I strive to improve my methods.  I learn what students understand, how they grasp problems, and what makes ideas "click."

  Although math was my first love, and the subject about which I am most passionate, I see potential to revolutionize education in ways which extend far beyond that one topic.  The idea of the school itself is one that is rapidly changing.  The advent of technology has encouraged many to apply the "digital" label to all aspects of learning: digital e-books, digital video courses, etc.  However, I think that the move to screens, computers, and the online sphere is happening too quickly in the wrong ways.  I am passionate about revolutionizing education through better teachers and teaching methods, not through shiny gadgets and modern buzzwords.

  GAKKO, therefore, is an opportunity to put my ideas to the test.  It is a forum which appeals to me because it promises a revolutionary approach to learning in all the right ways.  Who better than college students to be the revolutionary teachers?  I can't wait to begin!</td><td>My only goal for the near future is to have a job that allows me to create in the broadest sense of the word.

  Specifically, I would love to work at a design firm where I can exercise my technical skills alongside my graphic design and industrial design talents.

  Given my love of the French language, I would love to pursue such a career in Paris or Brussels.

  Above all, I would hope that my work leaves a lasting impact on the world, be it through social good, artistic merit, or technical innovation.</td><td>Calculus the Hard Way</td><td>﻿Calculus the Hard Way isn't actually the "hard" way.  Calculus is normally taught by telling students which formulas to apply, but not why to apply them or where they come from.  This is supposedly the "easy" way because it skips over all the “difficult” details.  In reality, the "hard" way, which delves into the pure, beautiful, fundamental concepts upon which math is built, is much easier and more rewarding in the long run.  In other words, the proofs and theory of calculus are so essential for understanding, that to skip over them, as is normally done in high school calculus courses, is a crime.

  Consider the topic of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  The theorem is normally taught merely as a means to find the area under part of a curve.  Students complete dull textbook exercises (applying the same concept the same way over and over) and move on to the next topic.  This course approaches the theorem in a completely different way.  First, we will explore how the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus was initially proven and learn about it’s originators: Newton and Leibniz.  With the proper context and history, we will begin to dissect it’s simplest form and the corollaries which follow.  Only after mastering the theory of why it works and how to prove it will we apply the theorem to a practical problem such as calculating area under a curve.  But once we complete the basic textbook problem, we still won’t be done.  I’ll introduce another topic, from a completely unrelated field, such as computational aerodynamics, and show how the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is used in the real world to calculate air flow over an airplane wing, for example.

  Of course, it’s easy to just propose a course which delves into both theory and applications.  The difficult part is to design a class which covers broad topics yet keeps students engaged and interested.  Math the Hard Way will revolutionize the way math courses are usually taught and get rid of the traditional concept of homework.

  The traditional function of homework is to give students time to practice using math concepts.  It forces them to repeat problems over and over so that they memorize how to use theorems and figure out the edge cases.  But why does this practice have to occur outside of class with boring, textbook problems?  Instead of assigning weekly homework, Math the Hard Way will have weekly drills.  These drills are in-class competitions where students race to finish multiple problems in the shortest amount of time.  Each week, the drill incorporates problems covered earlier in the course (to make sure that the material is always fresh in the student’s mind).  The in-class races solve the main problem of homework: they provide lots of repetition for practice (which is essential) without being dull.

  But what do students do at home?  Instead of textbook problems, I will assign a bigger project on a monthly basis.  Students will pick a topic of calculus that we haven’t covered in class.  They will research the topic and make a presentation to give to the rest of the students.  As they say, the best way to learn is to teach!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Semhal Tsegaye<br/>Yale University<br/>Sophomore<br/>semhal.tsegaye@yale.edu</td><td>I’ve spent a significant amount of my life working on educational development projects internationally, and as such have been exposed to a variety of education systems, none of which I believe inspire students or encourage enough innovation. In Ethiopia, I saw that education issues often revolve around a lack of access and unequipped teachers. Moreover, students are taught to pass a few crucial tests that essentially determine the trajectory of their education and life. I witnessed a similar situation in China, where students are taught for a test, and there’s little to no recognition of the validity in other types of learning. Along with a group of Yale students, I helped teach English classes, sat in on English classes and evaluated them, and gained student perspectives on their learning experience. When we delivered our feedback to the teachers and administration, the consistent reply was that even if we had useful ideas and the students were rightfully frustrated with the limitations of their education, this ultimately would not make a difference in their education. The teachers will continue to teach certain things and the students will continue to focus their energy on learning those things because that’s the only way they will pass the test and have access to further opportunities. Students are given no freedom for expression, exploration, or trial and error. 
  Even here at Yale, while we are given a certain degree of educational freedom, the push is still pre-professional, and oftentimes the way we are taught lacks innovation and inspiration. In my time here, I have found that, on the whole, I’ve gained more useful skills and knowledge from my experiences outside of a 300-person lecture hall than in it, highlighting a fundamental flaw in the contemporary conception of education. This is why I’m interested in GAKKO. I want to explore new ways of teaching and learning, ways that value creativity and inspiration, ways that will drive a new generation of independent and critical thinkers. 
  </td><td>In 10 years I see myself working in an international development context, specifically with regards to providing and improving educational opportunity for students in developing nations. This aspiration is largely informed by the international development work I’ve done, which has frustrated and inspired me, but ultimately convinced me that the most sustainable form of development is through the education of younger generations. I never cease to be inspired by the students I’ve worked with, and how the creativity and ingenuity is there, there is just no outlet for its development. My frustrations have come from witnessing unsuccessful development projects being recycled over and over because not enough people are taking the time to take risks and try new endeavors. These ideas are usually disconnected, archaic, top-down, and Western. I want to explore more localized solutions, solutions that stem from the environments they aim to improve rather than a conference room in Washington DC. 
  More specifically, I see myself working either for an organization that encourages initiative and innovation or conducting an independent development project. </td><td>How (Not) to be a Leader</td><td>Many students are trained to believe that to be a leader is to be superior. There are a plethora of programs dedicated to fostering leadership, but they make the assumption that leadership is the pinnicle of success, and don’t ask some vital questions: How is leadership defined? Why should we all strive to be leaders? When are somebody’s skills more valuable in non-leadership roles? Oftentimes, students are taught that with certain “leadership qualities,” they are equipped to take on any array of leading roles. This mindset could be detrimental not only to the situation they are leading, but also to the development of their skills that may be better cultivated in a supporting role. It is valuable to know how to be an effective leader, but it’s just as, if not more, important to recognize when one would be more effective as a non-leader. This class will lay the foundations for students to think critically about their strengths and weaknesses and how this affects their leadership and non-leadership roles.
  In this class, students will be placed into groups and each group will be given a problem or situation to resolve. The first step will be to determine how a “leader” would enhance this process, and if a leading role is necessary. Students will then engage in a thorough self-assessment, by which they will determine whether they are best suited to lead the development of a solution (if a leader is deemed necessary) or take a more supporting role. I will stress the difference between being an active versus a passive follower. A passive supporter is one who simply does what they are told, while an active supporter presents new ideas and takes initiative, but respects the “big picture” that the group has agreed upon. There may be multiple leaders or no leaders, supporting roles can work together, there may be overlap between leaders and supporting roles, essentially any combination the students choose. The students will then proceed to work together to formulate a solution to their problem, after which they will evaluate their decisions and the process it took to get there, ultimately deriving whether they had a productive experience and how it could be improved. 
  One limitation of this class is the process by which students evaluate themselves. It may be better if the students know each other well, which would enable them to assess the best role for them based off of the group dynamic rather than on a completely individual basis. Another flaw is that students may work better independently, and this activity is very much group-oriented. Despite these limitations, I think there is a lot to gain from a critical assessment of one’s skills in a team dynamic. In order for students’ skills to be better cultivated and the work of a group to be more productive, it is important to let go of the idea that they are somehow more valuable if they are “leaders”. After all, a leader is only as strong as their followers. </td></tr>

  (Foreword: there might be some other teaching techniques that I will add to finalize)

  Being an international student, I have been aware of some of the differences in the few languages I’ve known. For example, I was never able to fully translate some of the English words concisely and accurately into Chinese. So I question, since the language we use are so different, could it be reasoned that different languages make people think differently? If mere translation doesn’t work, how are we to communicate, to reach perfect understanding and mutual appreciation?

  First I would like to experience the power of language with my students. I will tell some classic stories, for example: “A blind beggar sits on a cold winter street in London. His mere wretchedness is heart-breaking for anyone, yet the hat before him is almost empty. Then the great poet Byron came by, and wrote a line by his side, ‘Spring is here, but I can’t see.’ And the words worked like magic, as soon his hat was full of change.” This is one of the instances where language romanticizes and facilitates communication. We’ll discuss how language gives things meaning and make them important. We’ll have  students give their own experiences, and try to make an ordinary scene more meaningful with a few words.

  Then we will briefly apply these ideas into the American Japanese cultural differences: are our cultures different because our words and grammar are a little different? For example, we could reflect upon that English words usually have more connotations and a lot of different meanings, and they tend to create ambiguity---that has influenced American jokes and the structure of the influential speeches made in English.

  Second and most importantly, we will examine what language lacks to capture. I will first show a pencil drawing to half of the students, and let students describe them as accurately as possible to each of their partners, and let the partners re-draw the scene. This might be impossible, but it reflects the fact, that language though allows us to communicate information, actually itself limits how much information could be transported.

  The thoughts in our minds are invariably in the carriers of language. Any analysis, reason, mathematical proof or logic is carried out by language. Without it, there is no reason or logic. Since reason and logic are even themselves limited in the framework of grammar and linguistics, there are a lot of reasonable things that aren’t fully justified by the system of logic, like emotions, like impulses of romance.

  I shall demonstrate by having students thinking about a very memorable event in their life that gives them seas of emotions, and try to put them down in words. I shall also ask them to watch a really influential movie, and we try to discuss the significance and life lessons of the movie. But after these, I would subtly point out that however hard we try, there’s always something lost. I never want to talk about the very influential moments in my life, because they convey far more broad and intense meanings to me than any language could possibly capture. I never want to put them down in words as to limit my understanding of the event. And similarly, I never want to read a film review after a movie, because those words too, will limit my understanding too. (I welcome arguments and discussion of what they usually like to do under certain circumstances).

  So beyond the expression of language what do we do?

  I will try to collect some Japanese songs that were really popular during a certain period of time, such songs that everyone would have heard and heard a lot during a certain period. I will play those songs, and let the students close their eyes and feel. Usually this will invoke some of the very treasurable memories and feelings stored in their minds. I will ask them to discuss what they felt and remembered, and how the feelings were different from their diaries or the images stored in their heads. Music carry memories, especially the certain feelings that have characterized the person’s life in that period.
  By using that example, we will discuss how beyond words, the various forms of art, music and even poetry, etc. could convey more. We will use different art forms or music to try to self-express. In class, I will ask everyone to do a project: use every means you can imagine write a love letter, to your parents or your lover or sibling, without using one word. I want them to express beyond just the limiting boundaries of language, using music, drawings, designs, dance, songs, photography, etc.

  I will also ask students to imagine life in terms what people write in biographies: going to college, get a job, form a family and ask why a life like that sounds very, very boring? That’s because that life is just part of life captured by words. That is not life at all. The art, romance and intricacies that form a greater part of life truly make our lives extraordinary.

  The ultimate meaning of this course, is that under the different languages that might separate us country by country, there is something deeper, something about the essence of human beings, something that we could mutually understand and appreciate without barriers of words, that unite us and steer us toward a better, brighter future.

  <tr><td>Larissa Liburd<br/>Yale<br/>Junior<br/>larissa.liburd@yale.edu</td><td>I was born and lived for several years in Port Au Prince, Haiti; it was only after I moved that my mother began to impress upon me the importance of an educational foundation. She made it very clear that we were in America now so that my brother and I could avoid the pitfalls of former generations who were born, had lived, and died unable to escape the misery of the Caribbean. My mother's own educational experience was one split between the opportunities and automatic success she found in private school and the quiet despair of the ill-regulated public school system, followed by the salvation of a generous public scholarship to medical school. The education to happiness pipeline was, for her, very clear - but it hasn't been as easy for me. I spent three years working with students in the disappointingly test-based Floridian public school systems through nationally recognized non-profit, Breakthrough Collaborative. At Yale, I have participated in and now supervise the Hemispheres program (a YIRA constituent body) that promotes an understanding of the wider world to interested and at-risk New Haven high school students. For the past year now, my academic studies have focused on education as a method of long-term poverty alleviation and overall political restructuring. On my own, I'm involved in a long-term partnership with Hope for Haiti, LEVE Haiti, the Haitian American Leadership Organization, and other associated non-profit agencies to fund the construction of an experimental tuition-free boarding school in Haiti’s southern countryside, where students are required to dedicate their summers and time off from school to public service and leadership. My involvement in all of these has exposed me to various methods of teaching, beliefs about the purpose of education, and the takeaway that students themselves receive at the end of each lesson. I am interested in the GAKKO program because I believe it asks the same questions I do; I think GAKKO does not believe that education should be a stagnant, year to year experience meant to simply inform, but that it is meant to be a dynamic system providing inspiration, conduits towards creativity, and an applicability to the real-world in a manner that caters to each student's interests as an individual. That is an outlook I can truly appreciate and sympathize with. </td><td>I am definitely not decided, but from conversations with my parents I have gleaned that it would be a good idea for me to have graduated from grad school with a joint MPP/JD or MPP/MBA or any combination of the three, gained some experience in the finance/consulting world, and to be a few years into an independent consulting practice that offers advice and real-world solutions to modern weak and failed states. For Haiti, specifically, for example, the consulting practice would have teamed up with a real estate business for the purpose of designing resorts or other touristy destinations along the coast and funneling half of the government-owned profit towards poverty alleviation programs inland. Half-jokingly, I will also say here that I might be in the early phases of a campaign for political office, although I'm not sure if that will be in Haiti or America. I also have high hopes for the continued success and growth of my experimental boarding school. </td><td>The Modern World</td><td>I took a class this semester called the Democracy and Psychology of Inequality, where we discussed the nature of inequality at length. As we delved into cultural and societal notions of inequality instead of traditional economical notions, students couldn’t understand inequality as it related to the innate patriarchy of society, and grappled with the equality existing in fundamentalist Islamic nations like Saudi Arabia ("Is equality a social construct too?!", one especially frustrated student asked). I brought up the gender binary and how those outside of it were systematically repressed, but students could not wrap their heads around pansexuality. When discussing racism and the glass ceiling, a furious debate arose over the "color/gender-blind" present some of the class believed we resided in and the "ever-struggle" others saw as the present and future.

  I strongly believe that a true education can only be had in an unrestricted and fully informed environment – but the students that our high school classrooms have continually produced are those well-versed in the arts of memorization, cramming, pop culture, and ever-changing hobbies. I feel more and more that no college-aged student is well-versed in the knowledge of themselves or the people around them. No one understands - or tries to understand - each other. The results of such inward-looking looking social views are the Republican primaries of 2012, Mitt Romney’s 47% speech, the vicious and bullying high school culture, Quran burnings, the Westboro Baptist Church, the college rape culture, and the slayings of Rodney King and Matthew Shepard. 

  The purpose of this class would therefore be to bring all of the aforementioned topics, along with others, up for discussion. Each class would have an anecdotal opening (through video clips, a skit presented by students, etc), followed by a brief rundown of all pertinent definitions. Students would then be asked to engage in conversation regarding their views on the topic; controversial observations would be encouraged, and to make sure that the open atmosphere was maintained, students would be required to sign a privacy pledge. Take-home assessments would be brief papers asking students to argue both sides of the issue, or to discuss the subject with someone whom they knew had differing opinions and explain why this person may have held this opinion.

  While the class’s express purpose is to inform students about the reality behind the modern world around them, I predict that it will also inculcate a sense of empathy, a willingness to change opinions and therefore to listen, and a generally more political and social sense of activism within each one of the students who takes it. Students will leave the classroom still speaking about these issues. The ramifications of their opinions will be laid bare for them as real actions and their consequences on the nightly news and around the world. A class like this has the potential to connect students to each other and to the wider world through simple and endless conversation – and that is why I would love to teach it.</td></tr>
